        "abstract": "Identification of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) candidates to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) is still a matter of debate. Currently, transplantation is reserved to patients considered at high risk of relapse based on cytogenetics, molecular biology, and minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. However, no randomized clinical trial exists in the literature comparing transplantation with other types of consolidation therapy. Here, we provide an up-to-date meta-analysis of studies comparing allo-HSCT in CR1 with chemotherapy alone as a post-remission treatment in high-risk pediatric AML. The literature search strategy identified 10 cohorts from 9 studies performing as-treated analysis. The quantitative synthesis showed improved overall survival (OS) (relative risk, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06\u20131.24; P\u2009=\u20090.0006) and disease-free survival (relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.17\u20131.47; P\u2009=\u20090.0001) in the allo-HSCT group, with increased relapse rate in the chemotherapy group (relative risk, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07\u20131.49; P\u2009=\u20090.006). Sensitivity analysis including prospective studies alone and excluding studies that reported the comparison only on intermediate-risk patients confirmed the benefit of allo-HSCT on OS. Further research should focus on individualizing allo-HSCT indications based on molecular stratification and MRD monitoring.",
