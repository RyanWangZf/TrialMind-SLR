        "abstract": "Background & purpose: To report disease-free survival (DFS) for volume-based and point-A based brachytherapy (BT) in locally advanced cervical cancer.\n\nMaterials & methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the effects of point-A and volume-based brachytherapy on 3-year DFS. Studies including stage I-IVA cervical cancer patients were included if standard treatment of concomitant chemo-radiotherapy and high-dose- or pulsed dose rate BT was delivered. The primary outcome was 3-year DFS, and secondary outcomes were 3-year local control (LC), 3-year overall survival (OS) and late toxicity. A random-effects subgroup meta-analysis was done.\n\nResults: In total, 5499 studies were screened, of which 24 studies with 5488 patients were eligible. There was significant heterogeneity among point-A studies (1538 patients) (I2 = 82%, p < 0.05) relative to volume-based studies (3950 patients) (I2 = 58, p = 0.01). The 3-year DFS for point-A and volume-based studies were 67% (95% CI 60%-73%) and 79% (95% CI 76%-82%) respectively (p = 0.001). Three-year LC for point-A and volume-based studies were 86% (95% CI 81%-90%) and 92% (91%-94%) respectively (p = 0.01). The difference in 3-year OS (72% vs. 79%, p = 0.12) was not statistically significant. The proportion of prospectively enrolled patients was 23% for point-A studies and 33% for volume-based studies. There was no difference in late grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.76) genitourinary toxicities (3% vs. 3% p = 0.45) between the two groups.\n\nConclusion: Volume-based BT results in superior 3-year DFS and 3-year LC. In the absence of randomized trials, this meta-analysis provides the best evidence regarding transition to 3D planning.\n\nKeywords: Brachytherapy; Disease-free survival; Image-guided radiation therapy; Uterine cervical neoplasms.",
