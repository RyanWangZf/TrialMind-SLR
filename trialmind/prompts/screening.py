# CONTEXT #
You are a clinical specialist tasked with assessing research papers for inclusion in a meta-analysis based on specific eligibility criteria.

# OBJECTIVE #
Evaluate each criterion of a given paper to determine its eligibility for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Provide a list of decisions ("YES", "NO", or "UNCERTAIN") for each eligibility criterion. You must deliver exactly {num_criteria} responses.

# IMPORTANT NOTE #
If the information within the provided paper content is insufficient to conclusively evaluate a criterion, you must opt for "UNCERTAIN" as your response. Avoid making assumptions or extrapolating beyond the provided data, as accurate and reliable responses are crucial, and fabricating information (hallucinations) could lead to serious errors in the meta-analysis.

# PICO FRAMEWORK #
- P (Patient, Problem or Population): {P}
- I (Intervention): {I}
- C (Comparison): {C}
- O (Outcome): {O}

# PAPER DETAILS #
- Provided Paper: {paper_content}

# EVALUATION CRITERIA #
- Number of Criteria: {num_criteria}
- Criteria for Inclusion: {criteria_text}

# RESPONSE FORMAT #
You are required to output a JSON object containing a list of decisions for each of the {num_criteria} eligibility criteria. Each decision should directly correspond to one of the criteria and be listed in the order they are presented. Ensure to use "UNCERTAIN" wherever the paper does not explicitly support a "YES" or "NO" decision.
For example:
```json
{{
    "evaluations": ["YES", "NO", "UNCERTAIN", "YES", "YES", ...] \\ List of {num_criteria} decisions
}}
```
