       " 'Clinical Outcomes Among Immunotherapy-Treated Patients With Primary Cardiac Soft Tissue Sarcomas\\nBackground\\nPrimary cardiac soft tissue sarcomas (CSTS) affect young adults, with dismal outcomes.\\nObjectives\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with CSTS receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).\\nMethods\\nA retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study was conducted among patients with CSTS between 2015 and 2022. The patients were treated with ICI-based regimens. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Objective response rates were determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Treatment-related adverse events were graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.\\nResults\\nAmong 24 patients with CSTS, 17 (70.8%) were White, and 13 (54.2%) were male. Eight patients (33.3%) had angiosarcoma. At the time of ICI treatment, 18 patients (75.0%) had metastatic CSTS, and 4 (16.7%) had locally advanced disease. ICIs were administered as the first-line therapy in 6 patients (25.0%) and as the second-line therapy or beyond in 18 patients (75.0%). For the 18 patients with available response data, objective response rate was 11.1% (nÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa02 of 18). The median PFS and median OS in advanced and metastatic CSTS (nÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa022) were 5.7Â\\xa0months (95% CI: 2.8-13.3Â\\xa0months) and 14.9Â\\xa0months (95% CI: 5.7-23.7Â\\xa0months), respectively. The median PFS and OS were significantly shorter in patients with cardiac angiosarcomas than in those with nonangiosarcoma CSTS: median PFS was 1.7 vs 11Â\\xa0months, respectively (PÂ\\xa0< 0.0001), and median OS was 3.0 vs 24.0Â\\xa0months, respectively (PÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa00.008). Any grade treatment-related adverse events occurred exclusively in the 15 patients with nonangiosarcoma CSTS (nÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa07 [46.7%]), of which 6 (40.0%) were gradeÂ\\xa0â\\x89¥3.\\nConclusions\\nAlthough ICIs demonstrate modest activity in CSTS, durable benefit was observed in a subset of patients with nonangiosarcoma, albeit with higher toxicity.\\nCentral Illustration\\nPrimary tumors of the heart are rare. Approximately 75% of primary cardiac tumors take the form of benign mesenchymal tumors. Although uncommon, primary cardiac soft tissue sarcomas (CSTS) rank as the second most common type of primary cardiac neoplasm and account for the majority of malignant primary cardiac tumors. CSTS may occur at any age but tend to affect individuals in the third to fifth decades of life. The clinical presentation of patients with CSTS varies on the basis of tumor size and location, typically involving symptoms such as dyspnea and secondary symptoms such as embolic phenomena, conduction abnormalities, pericardial effusion, and occasional metastases to other sites such as bone, brain, and colon. Limited small-scale data exist to guide CSTS management. Although complete tumor excision is the preferred treatment strategy in most cases, depending on the tumor location in the heart, the infiltrative nature of these tumors and the extent of local invasion and metastases can make this approach unfeasible.\\nTreatment options for recurrent or metastatic CSTS are limited, and responses to anthracycline-based chemotherapy are short lived, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.4Â\\xa0months in patients treated with first-line palliative chemotherapy. Eventually, most patients succumb to metastatic disease, and the prognosis of patients with CSTS remains poor, characterized by a median overall survival (OS) ofÂ\\xa0<1 year.\\nThe introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has successfully shifted the treatment paradigm in oncology, and these agents have received regulatory approval for a broad spectrum of tumor types. In noncardiac sarcomas, clinical trials of ICIs have shown promising results, with response rates ranging between 5% and 37%. To date, however, there are no reports that examine clinical outcomes and side-effect profiles of patients with primary malignant cardiac tumors treated with ICIs. In this collective effort across multiple institutions, we present an exploration of the outcomes and side-effect profiles of patients with CSTS receiving ICIs.\\nMethods\\nPatient population\\nThis study was based on an analysis of a retrospective, multicenter database. Data from 8 participating institutions in the United States (Supplemental TableÂ\\xa01) were obtained and are currently housed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. According to the Declaration of Helsinki, this retrospective study was covered by the Institutional Review Board review at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (protocol 21-329) and local Institutional Review Boards at participating sites.\\nPatients included: 1) had cardiac masses identified by transthoracic echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; 2) had histologic diagnoses of CSTS; and 3) had received any line of ICI therapy (â\\x89¥1 dose), defined as antiâ\\x80\\x93programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or antiâ\\x80\\x93programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) alone or in combination with antiâ\\x80\\x93cytotoxic T lymphocyteâ\\x80\\x93associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) or other anticancer therapies (ie, chemotherapy or targeted agents) between 2015 and 2022. Patients were excluded if the primary site of origin was noncardiac and the pathology was not a sarcoma. CSTS were classified into 1 of 2 histologic cohorts: angiosarcoma and nonangiosarcoma.\\nClinical outcomes and toxicity profiles\\nThe primary endpoint of this study was OS, defined as the date of ICI initiation to death or censoring at the date of the last follow-up. The secondary endpoints were PFS, objective response rates (ORRs), and treatment-related adverse events (trAEs). PFS measured the time from ICI initiation to radiologic or clinical disease progression, death, or censoring at the date of the last follow-up. ORRs were assessed by board-certified radiologists at respective centers. Radiologists were blinded to clinical data, and RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1 was used for ORR determination whenever possible. For 4 patients, serial images were not available for RECIST version 1.1 measurements, and instead, response data from radiology reports were used (FigureÂ\\xa01). For the remaining 4 patients with response data, serial images were unavailable for radiology review, as they were obtained at outside institutions. trAEs were graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.\\nStatistical analysis\\nContinuous data are reported as median (Q1-Q3) and categorical data as count (percentage). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the median OS and PFS using 95% CIs with group comparisons performed using the log-rank test. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with partial response (PR) or complete response and the percentage reported with exact 95% CI using the exact Clopper-Pearson method. Group comparisons for ORR were performed using the Fisher exact test. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and PÂ\\xa0valuesÂ\\xa0<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\\nResults\\nCSTS cohort characteristics\\nAmong the 24 patients diagnosed with CSTS, the median age was 45 years (Q1-Q3: 37-54 years), with 13 men (54.2%) and 5 being Asian or Black patients (20.8%) (TableÂ\\xa01, Supplemental TableÂ\\xa02). The median follow-up time was 17.9Â\\xa0months (95% CI: 13.3 to not reached). The median cardiac mass diameter was 6Â\\xa0cm (Q1-Q3: 4.2-6.7Â\\xa0cm). The most common histologic subgroup was angiosarcoma (nÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa08 [33.3%]). The remaining CSTS cases were grouped into the nonangiosarcoma CSTS cohort (nÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa016 [66.7%]) (Supplemental FigureÂ\\xa01). Among the patients, 18 (75.0%) had metastatic CSTS, while 4 (16.7%) had locally advanced disease. Thirteen patients (54.2%) had histories of surgery with curative intent. Complications related to the cardiac mass developed in approximately 16 patients (66.7%), including heart failure (12.5%), valvulopathies (12.5%), and cardiac tamponade (8.3%) (TableÂ\\xa01). Baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 20 patients (83.3%) with CSTS, revealing cardiac thrombi in 7 (29.2%). Cardio-oncology referrals were made for 11 of 24 patients (45.8%). The baseline demographics, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment plans for each patient are shown in TableÂ\\xa01 and Supplemental TableÂ\\xa02. Among the 23 patients with available data, 4 had their PD-L1 status assessed, with 2 having tumor proportion scores of 0% and 2 with scores of 1% (Supplemental TableÂ\\xa02).\\nClinical outcomes\\nAll patients received anti-PD-1-based therapy, with ICIs administered as the first-line therapy in 4 patients and as the second-line therapy in 20 patients. The median number of treatment doses was 5 (Q1-Q3: 2-7). Supplemental TableÂ\\xa02 provides details on the treatment drug, including dosing, schedule, and the number of treatment cycles. Among the 24 patients, 22 (91.7%) received ICIs in the metastatic or locally advanced setting and were included in the subsequent analyses of clinical outcomes and toxicity (Supplemental FigureÂ\\xa01). For all 7 patients with advanced angiosarcoma, the reason for discontinuation was tumor progression, necessitating subsequent therapy or leading to death. In contrast, only 7 of 15 patients (46.7%) with advanced nonangiosarcoma discontinued ICI because of tumor progression. Among the 18 CSTS with response data, the ORR was 11.1% (2 of 18; 95% CI: 3.1%-33%), with response observed in 1 intimal sarcoma (nonangiosarcoma) and 1 angiosarcoma. Serial imagingâ\\x80\\x93based RECIST version 1.1 measurements were available for 14 patients (FigureÂ\\xa01). For the remaining 4 patients with response data, serial images were unavailable for radiologic review, as they were obtained at outside institutions. When stratifying by administered treatment regimens, 1 of 3 patients with CSTS on nivolumab and ipilimumab achieved a durable PR. Among the 4 patients with CSTS on anti-PD-1 therapy combined with non-ICI regimens, 1 patient on pembrolizumab and paclitaxel achieved a PR. None of the 11 patients with CSTS treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy responded, with 6 patients achieving stable disease as the best response.\\nThe median time on ICI treatment was longer for nonangiosarcoma CSTS compared with cardiac angiosarcomas (5.5Â\\xa0months [Q1-Q3: 3.3-13.5Â\\xa0months] vs 1.1Â\\xa0months [Q1-Q3: 0.6-3.8Â\\xa0months], respectively). The median PFS and OS in the overall cohort were 5.7Â\\xa0months (95% CI: 2.8-13.3Â\\xa0months) and 14.9Â\\xa0months (95% CI: 5.7-23.7Â\\xa0months), respectively (FiguresÂ\\xa02A and 2B, Supplemental TableÂ\\xa03). In an exploratory analysis, median PFS was significantly shorter for cardiac angiosarcoma vs nonangiosarcoma CSTS (1.7 vs 11Â\\xa0months; PÂ\\xa0< 0.0001) (FigureÂ\\xa02C). Similarly, median OS was significantly shorter among patients with cardiac angiosarcomas vs nonangiosarcoma CSTS (3.0 vs 24Â\\xa0months, respectively; PÂ\\xa0=Â\\xa00.008) (FigureÂ\\xa02D, Central Illustration). To better understand the role of treatment effect vs underlying disease biology, we calculated the PFS of both ICI treatment and the immediate prior systemic line of therapy (prior to ICI) whenever possible (FigureÂ\\xa03). Otherwise, we included the PFS of the subsequent systemic line of therapy after ICI as a comparator if there was no prior line. For the nonangiosarcoma histology, treatment with ICIs, on average, led to similar PFS compared with the prior systemic or subsequent lines of therapy. In contrast, all patients with angiosarcoma histology derived more benefit from the prior systemic line compared with ICI therapy, as shown by the PFS treatment intervals (FigureÂ\\xa03).\\nToxicity profiles\\ntrAEs occurred only in patients with nonangiosarcoma CSTS. trAEs of any grade occurred in 7 of 22 patients (31.8%) (Supplemental TableÂ\\xa04). Grade 3 and 4 trAEs were reported in 6 patients (27.3%), and 1 grade 5 pneumonitis was reported, leading to death. None had cardiac trAEs. Five patients (23%) required steroids to manage trAEs. ICIs were discontinued because of trAEs in 5 of 22 patients (22.7%). Six patients were hospitalized because of trAEs. The distributions of trAEs by histology, use of steroids, and discontinuation because of toxicity are shown in Supplemental TablesÂ\\xa02 and 4.\\nDiscussion\\nGiven the extent of potential person-years lost to related deaths, CSTS can have a considerable societal impact. Because of the rarity of CSTS, no randomized clinical trials have been performed to identify an optimal systemic treatment regimen, and chemotherapy protocols are extrapolated from extracardiac soft tissue sarcoma counterpart data. Additionally, no case reports or other low-evidence data are available regarding patients with CSTS treated with ICIs. For the first time, our data suggest that a subset of patients with primary CSTS can achieve clinical benefit from ICI therapy. Both patients with CSTS whose tumors responded were treated with anti-PD-1-based combinations. Our exploratory analysis revealed that clinical benefit among patients with CSTS treated with ICIs is histology specific, whereas cardiac angiosarcomas showed dismal outcomes compared with patients with nonangiosarcoma CSTS. The swimmer plot analysis of ICI and non-ICI PFS outcomes suggests that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 ICIs are not as effective for patients with angiosarcoma but likely have a role as a combination approach with anti-CTLA-4 or chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with nonangiosarcoma CSTS histologies. Moreover, most patients with nonangiosarcoma histologies achieved durable benefit (12-month stable disease or complete response or PR as the best response) when treated with ICIs (1 of 2 intimal, 3 of 7 pleomorphic, and 2 of 4 spindle cell sarcoma).\\nPrior studies have demonstrated remarkable responses to ICIs in patients with cutaneous angiosarcomas. Although the UV mutation signature may explain responses to cutaneous angiosarcoma, this phenomenon likely does not apply to angiosarcomas of visceral organs, such as the heart. Moreover, the aggressive clinical course of visceral angiosarcoma compared with cutaneous angiosarcoma probably makes it less suitable for ICI treatment. In the SARC028 phase 2 study of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab, ORRs of 18% (soft tissue) and 5% (bone) were observed among 84 patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcoma. Although monotherapy with the anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab in patients with synovial sarcoma was disappointing, with no responses observed in 6 patients, leading to study closure, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab resulted in an ORR of 16%, compared with 5% with nivolumab monotherapy. The ICI combination led to a median PFS of 4.1Â\\xa0months and OS of 14.3Â\\xa0months.\\ntrAE rates were higher in patients with nonangiosarcoma CSTS compared with those with angiosarcoma. This may be related to a significantly longer time on ICI treatment in the nonangiosarcoma group. Importantly, none of the patients experienced major adverse cardiac events such as myocarditis. In our study, two-thirds of patients had complications related to their cardiac masses, with nearly 30% having cardiac thrombi. In addition, referrals to cardio-oncology wereÂ\\xa0<50%, thus highlighting the critical need for multidisciplinary care in patients with CSTS.\\nStudy limitations\\nOur study was limited by its retrospective nature and potential selection bias from large academic centers. Our cohort of patients receiving ICI constituted only a small fraction of those receiving other systemic therapies for cardiac sarcomas, likely representing a relatively healthier population. Moreover, the majority of patients in our study received ICIs as the second-line therapy or beyond for metastatic CSTS, for which clinical outcomes may be dismal. Therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted cautiously in this context. It is worth mentioning that we lacked biomarker data, and only a limited number of patients underwent next-generation sequencing because, in the current landscape, no known biomarkers have been associated with therapeutic implications in soft tissue sarcoma in general. For example, more than 80% of the patients who received immunotherapy did not have tumors testing for PD-1 or PD-L1 status. Only 3 patients had available genomic data; therefore, we excluded the genomic data from the present study.\\ntrAEs were common among patients with nonangiosarcoma histology, but this may be confounded by the longer duration of treatment. A competing risk analysis (considering ICI discontinuation because of progression or other reasons) would account for this but could not be performed because of limited data on the time of occurrence of trAEs. Nevertheless, given the lack of treatment options and limitations to clinical trials specifically for this rare tumor patient population, we hope our work further augments the evaluation of anti-PD-1-based combination approaches that could benefit patients with CSTS.\\nConclusions\\nCOMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: ICIs are associated with durable clinical benefit in a subset of patients with CSTS of nonangiosarcoma histology.\\nTRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future research is warranted to determine genomic and clinical biomarkers that can predict response to ICIs among patients with CSTS.\\nIn this first ever report of ICIs in patients with CSTS, a subset of patients with nonangiosarcoma histology treated with anti-PD-1-based combinations derived clinical benefit, compounded by higher trAEs. The high rate of cardiac massâ\\x80\\x93related complications highlights the need for multidisciplinary interventions to support patients as they receive cancer-directed therapy.\\nFunding Support and Author Disclosures\\nDr Abdel-Wahab is supported by a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant K01AI163412) and has received the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Research Grant, Division of Internal Medicine Development Award, Survivorship Seed Money Award, Prioritizing Research Innovation and Mentoring Excellence Award, and Melanoma SPORE Career Enhancement Program Award.

       " 'Remarkable response to pazopanib plus vivolumab in a patient with pericardial synovial sarcoma carrying a novel genotype BRCA2 c.968dupT: A case report \\nAbstract\\nPericardial synovial sarcomas (PSS) have a low incidence rate and are highly invasive with a dismal prognosis. Standard treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy but with limited response. Here, we report the case of a 15â\\x80\\x90yearâ\\x80\\x90old nonsmoking youngster diagnosed with PSS who developed disease relapsed from surgery after 1â\\x80\\x89month. Nextâ\\x80\\x90generation sequencing (NGS) using baseline tissue was performed, and BRCA2 c.968dupT was detected. Then pazopanib (a multitargeted inhibitor) plus nivolumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) was administered, with a partial response and progressionâ\\x80\\x90free survival of 14â\\x80\\x89months. BRCA2 c.968dupT has not previously been reported in PSS and its response to targeted combination immunotherapy are not well characterized. Here, we report the efficacy of pazopanib combined with nivolumab in a PSS patient harboring BRCA2 c.968dupT and also provide the clinical evidence of the utility of NGS in exploring actionable mutations for solid tumor. Combination therapy based on immunotherapy may be a potential treatment choice for PSS harboring BRCA2 mutation.\\nA huge solid cystic mass located in the mediastinum was found in a 15â\\x80\\x90yearâ\\x80\\x90old youngster suffering shortness of breath. The synovial sarcoma was diagnosed by tissue of emergency surgery. One month later, the mediastinum lesion of patient relapsed. The nextâ\\x80\\x90generation sequencing was performed and revealed BRCA2 c.968dupT mutation. Eventually, the pazopanib plus nivolumab was administered with progressionâ\\x80\\x90free survival of 14 months. \\nINTRODUCTION\\nSynovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare malignancy of mesenchymal origin, accounting for approximately 8%â\\x80\\x9310% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It most commonly affects young adults between the ages of 15 and 30â\\x80\\x89years. SS can occur in almost any anatomic site, and more than 80% originate in the deep soft tissues of the extremities. However, it occasionally occurs in rare sites such as the head and neck, lungs, chest wall, mediastinum, orbit, and esophagus, and pericardial SS has been reported rarely. The diagnosis of SS is based on histology and molecular biology tests including t(X;18) chromosomal translocation confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptionâ\\x80\\x90polymerase chain reaction (RTâ\\x80\\x90PCR). The treatment of PSS varies, but usually involves surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Despite these multimodal treatment options, the prognosis for patients with synovial sarcomas remains poor, with an expected 5â\\x80\\x90year survival in adult patients ranging from 50% to 60%. \\nPazopanib is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that predominantly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3. Pazopanib is approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), which have some activity in synovial sarcomas. In the NCT00753688 study, pazopanib was administered to 369 patients with metastatic softâ\\x80\\x90tissue sarcoma after failure of standard chemotherapy. Progressionâ\\x80\\x90free survival (PFS) and significant improvement was observed with pazopanib compared with a placebo (4.6â\\x80\\x89vs. 1.6â\\x80\\x89months). In a retrospective Japanese study, patients with SS received pazopanib and the PFS was 16.4â\\x80\\x89weeks. Immunotherapy has led to a breakthrough in treatment with approval as firstâ\\x80\\x90line treatment by the FDA due to a robust response, including lung cancer, head and neck carcinoma and breast cancer. The efficacy of PDâ\\x80\\x901 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) has been also investigated in SS. The SARC028 study revealed that pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, with an mPFS of 4.2â\\x80\\x89months, 18% of responses and a 6â\\x80\\x90month progressionâ\\x80\\x90free survival rate (PFSR) of 32%. Similar results were observed also in the NCT03277924 registration study. The combination of antiangiogenic agents and nivolumab was investigated in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, with an mPFS of 5.6â\\x80\\x89and a 6â\\x80\\x90month PFSR of 48%. \\nBreastâ\\x80\\x90cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) is normally involved in the sophisticated DNA repair process, especially the homologous recombination pathway of doubleâ\\x80\\x90strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms. It is a tumor suppressor gene, and the most common mutations in BRCA2 are shift and missense mutations, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy is commonly administered in cancer patients harboring BRCA2 mutation. The response of nivolumab in BRCAâ\\x80\\x90mutant recurrent ovarian cancer is robust and in a previous study the objective response rate was 67%. \\nHere, we present a patient with BRCA2â\\x80\\x90mutant PSS who could benefit from pazopanib combined with nivolumab and achieved a partial response with PFS of 14â\\x80\\x89months.\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 15â\\x80\\x90yearâ\\x80\\x90old nonsmoking youngster visited Hunan Cancer Hospital with a history of cough and shortness of breath for 2â\\x80\\x89weeks. His symptoms worsened over a few days. He had no history of trauma and tumor. No specific other symptoms were reported, and his blood tests were almost normal. Physical examination showed his heart rate was 110 beats per minute. No blood sputum was present. There was no fever, no shivering, and no lymphadenopathy. Color ultrasonography showed pericardial effusion. Results of emergency computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge solid cystic mass located in the mediastinum with pericardial effusion (FigureÂ\\xa01a,b). To avoid tamponade, the patient received emergency pericardium fenestration surgery. In the surgery, it was obvious to see the pericardium contained dark red pericardial effusions. An approximately 25â\\x80\\x89Ã\\x97â\\x80\\x8925â\\x80\\x89cm lump surrounded the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery from the anterior superior mediastinum and covered the surface of the beating heart. The lumps grew downward into the pericardium and were adherent to the surface of the right ventricular outflow tract. The boundary of the mass was still clear, which was resected during the operation. Grossly, the fleshy mass had multinodular cysts, which were filled with dark red bloody fluid (FigureÂ\\xa01c). Histological examination revealed uniform spindle cells tightly arrayed with round and ovoid cell nucleus (FigureÂ\\xa01d), which was the most typical subtype of synovial sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry staining was negative for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CK19, Syn, CD34, myoD1, myoglobin CD68, CK18, SMA, and Sâ\\x80\\x90100 but positive for calponin, vimentin, Bcl2, CD99, CD56, and TLE. A large panel gene detection including 168 somatic gene mutations showed that the genotype of this patient was BRCA2 c.968dupT, ERBB3 p.T1225I, and MSH2 p.272â\\x80\\x89fs. The TPS score of PDâ\\x80\\x90L1 expression was 0 (22C3, Dako). Based on the clinical symptoms, gross findings, histological examination, and immunohistochemistry, the patient was diagnosed with pericardial synovial sarcoma.\\nResults of base sequence analysis showed that, after inserting with a â\\x80\\x9cT,â\\x80\\x9d the whole gene was frameshift and transformed to be a new nonsense mutation, and we found that amino acid from code 326 to code 3419 was lost (FigureÂ\\xa02a). Protein analysis showed all the active peptides, including RAD51 binding site and functional domains were almost destroyed (FigureÂ\\xa02b,c).\\nSynovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm that occurs mainly in older children and young adults. A diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is based on histology and molecular biology tests including t(X;18) chromosomal translocation confirmed by FISH or RTâ\\x80\\x90PCR. The treatment of SS varies, usually involving surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. After progression, there are no standard treatments apart from those in clinical trials. Without standard adjuvant chemotherapy, positron emission tomography (PET)â\\x80\\x90CT scan showed that the disease had relapsed after 1â\\x80\\x89month. Based on the pathology and genotype, pazopanib (GlaxoSmithKline, 800â\\x80\\x89mg, per os, once a day) combined with nivolumab (Bristolâ\\x80\\x90Myers Squibb, 3â\\x80\\x89mg/kg bodyweight, intravenously guttae, every 2â\\x80\\x89weeks) were initiated. A partial response was obtained after treatment for 6â\\x80\\x89weeks later with a chest CT evaluation. The adverse events were gray hair. The patient still had a consistent partial response for at least 14â\\x80\\x89months.\\nDISCUSSION\\nSynovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm that commonly occurs in older children and young adults and various treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. BRCA2 is involved in DNA repair process and functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and aberrant BRCA2 promotes tumor growth. Currently, few studies have reported PSS with BRCA2 mutation and the therapy is still ambiguous. Here, we first present a PSS patient who experienced disease relapse, BRCA2 mutation was identified by nextâ\\x80\\x90generation sequencing (NGS) and had a robust response to pazopanib plus nivolumab with PFS of 14â\\x80\\x89months. This case suggests that BRCA2 mutation might be the molecular driver of a subset of PSS and a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy may be a potential option for these patients.\\nPazopanib, a multitargeted TKI that predominantly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and plateletâ\\x80\\x90derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), has been shown to increase immune cell infiltration of the tumor microenvironment by normalization of the tumor vasculature. Nivolumab, an inhibitor of programmed cell death receptorâ\\x80\\x901 (PDâ\\x80\\x901), has shown strong antitumor activity and improved survival outcome regardless of PDâ\\x80\\x90L1 expression level in nonâ\\x80\\x90small cell lung cancer. Some researchers believe nivolumab could alleviate inhibitory T cell signaling independently of tumoral PDâ\\x80\\x90L1 expression; for example, by blocking interactions with other PDâ\\x80\\x901 ligands such as PDâ\\x80\\x90L2. The patient in our study was treated with pazopanib plus nivolumab with a partial response of up to 14â\\x80\\x89months, although with negative PDâ\\x80\\x90L1 expression. We speculate that pazopanib plus nivolumab caused a synergistic effect by increasing immune cell infiltration and facilitating immunotherapy response.\\nAs this is only a single case report, more clinical studies are needed to explore the mechanism driving PSS and validate the efficacy of a combination of pazopanib and nivolumab in patients with PSS. The present study is also limited by the lack of an in vitro functional assay for BRCA2 and its sensitivity profile to BRCA inhibitors and various combination therapy based on immunotherapy.\\nIn conclusion, we first present the good efficacy of pazopanib plus nivolumab in a PSS patient harboring a BRCA2 c.968dupT mutation. NGS is also supposed to be applied for subsequent treatment in patients with rapid disease progression.',\n",
       " \"Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors\\nBackground\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the prognosis of cancer. Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been shown to have a negative effect on patients treated with ICIs. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are effective antidiabetic therapies associated with reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.\\nObjective\\nTo evaluate the prognostic value of SGLT2i on all-cause mortality and cardiotoxicity among patients treated with ICIs.\\nMethods\\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with cancer and type 2 DM (DM2) and treated with ICIs at our center. Patients were divided into two groups according to baseline treatment with or without SGLT2i. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint was MACE, including myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmia.\\nResults\\nThe cohort included 119 patients, with 24 (20%) patients assigned to the SGLT2i group. Both groups exhibited a comparable prevalence of cardiac risk factors, although the SGLT2i group displayed a higher incidence of ischemic heart disease. Over a median follow-up of 28 months, 61 (51%) patients died, with a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate in the SGLT2i group (21% vs. 59%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.002). While there were no significant differences in MACE, we observed zero cases of myocarditis and atrial fibrillation in the SGLT2i, compared to 2 and 6 cases in the non-SGLT2i group.\\nConclusions\\nSGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower all-cause mortality rate in patients diagnosed with cancer and DM2 and treated with ICIs. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism and evaluate its benefit on cardiotoxicity.\\nGraphical Abstract\\nIntroduction\\nTumor cells can avoid the host immune response and allow cell proliferation and metastasis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the prognosis of various types of cancer by stimulating the hostâ\\x80\\x99s immune system to target tumor cells, thus leading to reductions in the tumor's ability to evade the hostâ\\x80\\x99s defense mechanisms and thereby hindering tumor cell survival. Accordingly, the use of ICIs therapy is increasing, both for metastatic disease and in earlier disease settings, with nearly 50% of patients with cancer eligible for ICIs therapy. Several ICIs therapies are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including programmed death-1 inhibitor (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 inhibitor (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyteâ\\x80\\x93associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).\\nThe response to ICIs therapy is diverse among the population, and while most patients will greatly benefit from the therapy, others will not. Therefore, there is a worldwide scientific focus to discover predisposing factors that may influence the response and prognosis of patients planned for ICIs therapy. One of these commonly researched factors is Diabetes mellitus (DM)â\\x80\\x94which has been shown to have a negative effect on overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with ICIs.\\nMoreover, the stimulation of the immune system may lead to inappropriate activation of pro-inflammatory T cells, which may infiltrate different organs, causing damage to the organs and leading to significant morbidity and mortality and the premature discontinuation of efficacious cancer therapy. ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity are relatively rare complication, however, potentially fatal. While myocarditis is the most studied complication, other manifestations include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), heart failure (HF), and arrhythmias.\\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are effective antidiabetic therapies in patients with type 2 DM (DM2) and are associated with improved glycemic control, reductions in body mass, improved blood pressure, and reduced overall mortality and CV outcomes. Recently, the beneficial effects of SGLT2i have been shown to improve cardiac outcomes and OS in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines, as well as among a broad range of cancer therapies. Currently, there is no data regarding the potential benefit of SGLT2i among patients diagnosed with DM2 and treated with ICIs therapy.\\nOur study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of baseline therapy with SGLT2i among patients diagnosed with cancer and DM2, treated with ICIs therapies, on the development of all-cause mortality and ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity.\\nMethods\\nStudy population and protocol\\nWe conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational study at Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a tertiary cancer center in Israel.\\nConsecutive medical records of all patients diagnosed with cancer and DM2, and treated with ICIs therapy were reviewed. Exclusion criteria included age of less than 18 years.\\nPatients were divided into two groups: patients treated with SGLT2i prior to ICIs therapy initiation â\\x80\\x93 the SGLT2i group and patients not treated with SGLT2i â\\x80\\x93 the non-SGLT2i group.\\nThe study was approved by the local Helsinki regulatory ethics committee (Identifier: TLV-0228â\\x80\\x9316)\\nData collection\\nData including baseline medical history and medications, malignancy status, ICIs therapy, previous chemotherapy therapy, blood tests, and echocardiography findings were obtained from health records. PFS was determined through a review of the electronic medical charts by an oncologist (B.W and O.B.).\\nStudy endpoints\\nThe primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, extracted from patient charts and the population registry bureau.\\nThe secondary endpoint was major adverseÂ\\xa0cardiovascularÂ\\xa0events (MACE), defined as the composite of myocarditis, ACS, HF exacerbation (including HF hospitalizations or emergency room visits due to either denovo or acute on chronic HF diagnosis), and arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). These endpoints were chosen, as they are considered as ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity. The diagnosis of each endpoint was determined through a review of the electronic medical charts by a cardio-oncologist (M.L.P), according to the accepted European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.\\nStatistical analysis\\nAll continuous variables are displayed as mean (Â±â\\x80\\x89standard deviation (SD)) for normally distributed variables, or median [interquartile range (IQR)] for variables with nonnormal distributions. Categorical variables are displayed as the number (%) of individuals within each group.\\nContinuous variables were compared by a two-tailed unpaired t-test for normally distributed variables and by the Mannâ\\x80\\x90Whitney U test for nonâ\\x80\\x90normally distributed ones. To assess associations among categorical variables, we used a Chi-square test. The median follow-up time for all-cause mortality was calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meir method.\\nAll-cause mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. Cumulative survival curves divided by SGLT2i treatment status are presented. We adjusted our model for age, gender, cancer type, cancer stage, protocol therapy, conventional risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, prior ischemic heart disease (IHD), and obesity), and use of medications (statins and reninâ\\x80\\x93angiotensinâ\\x80\\x93aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi)).\\nPFS between the groups was analyzed using Kaplanâ\\x80\\x93Meier methods and the log-rank test.\\nA two-tailed pâ\\x80\\x89<â\\x80\\x890.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with the SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics, version 28, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA, 2016), The R statistical package (version 3.3.1) (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and GraphPad Prism version 9.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).\\nResults\\nBaseline patient characteristics\\nFrom November 2015 to August 2022, 119 patients with cancer and the diagnosis of DM2, prior to the initiation of ICIs therapy, were identified and included in our cohort. Overall, the SGLT2i group included 24 (20%) patients and the non-SGLT2i group included 95 patients.\\nBaseline clinical characteristics are summarized in TableÂ\\xa01. Our cohortâ\\x80\\x99s mean age was 71â\\x80\\x89Â±â\\x80\\x8910 years and was predominantly male (62%). There were no significant differences in age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) between the two groups.\\nCancer types were similar between the SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i groups. The most common cancer diagnosis was non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) in both groups, with most patients classified as stage 4 (88%). While data regarding the burden of disease (brain, liver, bone, and lymph node metastasis) or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) stage was not available in all patients, no significant differences were observed between the groups (TableÂ\\xa01).\\nThe specific cancer therapy protocol was chosen by the treating oncologist according to current best practices. ICIs therapies included pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) (24%), nivolumab (anti-PD-1) (8%), avelumab (anti-PD-L1) (8%), atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) (30%) and combined ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4)â\\x80\\x89+â\\x80\\x89nivolumab (30%). The median number of cycles was 6. No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding the type of ICIs therapy, single or combined ICIs, the number of cycles, and the number of ICIs lines (TableÂ\\xa01). Overall, 39 (33%) patients were treated with a combined protocol therapy of ICIs and chemotherapy / biological therapy, with a significantly higher prevalence in the SGLT2i group (67% vs. 24%, pâ\\x80\\x89<â\\x80\\x890.001) (TableÂ\\xa01).\\nThere were 2 types of SGLTi therapies with the most common being empagliflozin (83%), followed by dapagliflozin (17%). No significant differences were observed regarding the use of metformin (pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.375) between the groups and only one patient was treated with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. Baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was available only in 43 patients with a higher trend in the SGLT2i group (7.1 [IQR 6.3, 8.3] vs. 6.6 [IQR 6.0, 6.9], pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.089).\\nBoth groups had similar prevalence of cardiac risk factors (HTN, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and chronic kidney disease (CKD)). However, a history of IHD was significantly higher in the SGLT2i group (42% vs. 17%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.019). While statin therapy was significantly higher among the SGLT2i group (92% vs. 63%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.014), no significant differences were observed regarding cardio-protective therapy, including RAASi, aldosterone receptor antagonist (MRA) and beta blockers (BB) (TableÂ\\xa01).\\nOverall, 46 patients (38%) had a baseline echocardiography assessment, with a trend for lower mean left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) in the SGLT2i group (50â\\x80\\x89Â±â\\x80\\x8916% vs. 57â\\x80\\x89Â±â\\x80\\x899%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.064) and 60 patients (50%) performed baseline high-sensitivity troponin I level, which was within the normal range (â\\x89¤â\\x80\\x8950 nanogram/Liter (ng/L)), with a trend for lower levels in the SGLT2i group (3.0 [0.5, 7.5]ng/L vs. 6.0 [4.0, 15.0]ng/L, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.056).\\nBaseline hematocrit (HCT) was significantly higher in the SGLT2i group (37â\\x80\\x89Â±â\\x80\\x896% vs. 33â\\x80\\x89Â±â\\x80\\x896%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.003). Other baseline labs including platelets, white blood cells, and creatinine were similar between both groups.\\nPrimary endpoint\\nOver a median follow-up of 28 [IQR 10, 43] months, 61 (51%) patients died, with a significantly lower all-cause mortality among the SGLT2i group (21% vs. 59%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.002) (TableÂ\\xa02). Using a multivariable cox regression analysis that included all baseline characteristics showing significant differences between the groups, or having a possible clinical significance (TableÂ\\xa03), SGLT2i emerged as an independent significant predictor for lower all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.300 (95% CI 0.104â\\x80\\x930.865), pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.026) (Fig.Â\\xa01). While combined protocol with chemotherapy did not emerge as a significant predictor for all-cause mortality, combined biological therapy had a protective value with lower mortality.\\nOnly 1 patient was classified as CV mortality and included in the non-SGLT2i group.\\nSecondary endpoints\\nOverall, 16 (13%) patients developed MACE during follow-up, 4 in the SGLT2i groups vs. 12 in the non-SGLT2i group. There were no significant differences in the composite of MACE between the SGLT2i and the non-SGLT2i groups (17% vs. 13%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.855) (Fig.Â\\xa02). Evaluating each parameter, we observed a higher non-significant incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) (6% vs. 0%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.458) and myocarditis (2% vs. 0%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x891.000) (TableÂ\\xa02) among the non-SGLT2i group, while higher incidence of HF exacerbation was observed among the SGLT2i group (8% vs. 5%, pâ\\x80\\x89=â\\x80\\x890.932).\\nNo significant differences were observed in PFS between the two groups (Fig.Â\\xa03).\\nDiscussion\\nIn our cohort, including patients diagnosed with cancer and DM2, and treated with ICIs therapy, baseline treatment with SGLT2i emerged as an independent strong prognosis predictor, with a 70% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to patients without SGLT2i. While no significant differences were observed regarding the incidence of MACE between the groups, patients treated with SGLT2i showed zero events of AF and myocarditis.\\nSGLT2i are effective antidiabetic therapies in patients diagnosed with DM2 and are associated with reduced mortality and CV outcome, as shown in the EMPA-REG and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials. The beneficial effects of SGLT2i have been proven to be well beyond glycemic control. The DAPA-HF trial showed that among patients with HF and a reduced LVEF, treatment with dapagliflozin reduced significantly the risk of worsening HF, CV death, and all-cause mortality compared to placebo, regardless of the presence or absence of DM2. In the EMEPROR-preserved trial, empagliflozin reduced the combined risk of CV death and hospitalization for HF in patients with HF and preserved LVEF, regardless of the presence or absence of DM2.\\nRecent trials have shown that SGLT2i may also have a beneficial effect on patients diagnosed with cancer. Gongora et al showed that SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality and cardiac events among patients with cancer and DM who were treated with anthracyclines, compared to a control group not treated with SGLT2i. Chiang et al observed the impact of SGLT2i on HF and mortality in patients with various types of cancer receiving different treatments and found that the use of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of incident HF and with prolonged survival in patients with cancer and DM2. Similar to those trials, in our study, we found that baseline treatment with SGLT2i among patients treated with ICIs therapy played an independent strong predictor for lower all-cause mortality.\\nIn general, DM2 was found to have a negative effect on survival and PFS in various types of cancer. One of the proposed theories is that hyperglycemia accelerates the progression of the tumor by enhancing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Jacobi et al showed that patients with DM2 and metastatic NSCLC who were treated with ICIs therapy had a worse outcome in PFS and survival compared to patients without DM2. Furthermoreâ\\x80\\x94recently, DM2 has been shown to have a negative effect specifically on patients with NSCLC treated with Pembrolizumab.\\nSeveral studies have shown that SGLT2i can slow tumor growth in mouse models of breast, colon, gastrointestinal, lung, and liver tumors by promoting a fasting-like state and mitigating hyper-insulinoma, so it may be interesting to consider that the beneficial effect of SGLT2i on patients with cancer might be an anti-neoplastic one. Preclinical studies showed that SGLT-specific positron emission tomography tracers accumulate in tumor cells and patient-derived xenografts and were reduced by SGLT2i. In our trial, the SGLT2i group had higher levels of HbA1C compared to the non-SGLT2i group, which reflects higher blood glucose levels/reduced glycemic control compared to the control group. Nonetheless, patients in the SGLT2i group had lower mortality rates, which strengthens the specific beneficial effect of SGLT2i treatment, beyond glycemic control, among patients with cancer.\\nAssessing the incidence of MACE, we did not find significant differences between the groups. This might be explained by the higher prevalence of baseline IHD among the SGLT2i group, and therefore the higher risk of developing MACE, compared to the non-SGLT2i group. Furthermore, we believe that ICI-induced cardiotoxicity is still underdiagnosed by the treating physician, as the majority of patients treated with ICIs do not perform routine CV assessment with electrocardiogram, cardiac biomarkers, and echocardiography. With the new ESC 2022 cardio-oncology guidelines, this might change soon. Large prospective trials are needed. Due to the low number of CV events, we could not discuss the statistical differences in each parameter of MACE. However, we observed zero events of AF, compared to 6 events in the non-SGLT2i group. A lower incidence of AF has also been described in the SGTL2i trials among the general popultaion, and might have contributed to the lower mortality in the SGLT2i group. There are multiple possible mechanisms through which SGLT2i may reduce AF, including a reduction in bodyÂ\\xa0weight, blood pressure, and volume. Studies on animal models indicate that SGLT2i may reduce atrial fibrosis and adverse remodeling, in addition to improving cellular metabolisms and bioenergetics such as ion handling and mitochondrial function. A recently published study by Avula et al. showed that diabetic oncologic patients with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or HF, due to cardio-toxic therapies showed improved CV outcomes, including HF exacerbations, when treated with SGLT2i. Contrary to those findings we did not observe a reduction in HF exacerbations in our study. These contradicting results can be explained by the difference in the cohort population. While the study by Avula et al included only patients with a baseline diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction of HF, this was not an inclusion criterion in our trial. Given the fact that SGLT2i are the first line recommended therapy for patients with CV disease, we noticed a significantly higher prevalence of IHD among the SGLT2I group. Therefore, we should not be surprised by the higher incidence of HF exacerbations among patients with baseline IHD, compared to patients without. Even though, those differences did not reach a statistically significant.\\nWhile the protective mechanism of SGL2i is still unclear, one important parameter is considered to be an anti-inflammatory effect. SGLT2i exerts anti-atherosclerotic properties attenuating inflammatory factors and reducing myocardial infarction, HF, and MACE in patients with DM2. As ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity is considered to be driven by the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm induced in myocardial tissues, the anti-inflammatory effect of SGLT2i may play a significant role in the prevention of ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity and mortality. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory effect might diminish the efficacy of ICIs therapy. Trying to asses this concern, we observed no differences in PFS, implying that SGLT2i did not reduce the efficacy of ICIs therapy. Furthermore, patients in the SGLT2i group presented with lower all-cause mortality, which probably insinuates that this mechanism is more complex. In theory, it is possible that this anti-inflammatory effect could explain the absence of myocarditis diagnosis in this group, a fatal disease caused by overactivation of the immune system, compared to the two diagnosed cases in the non-SGLT2i group. While statin therapy was more prevalent in the SGLT2i group and is known for its anti-inflammatory effect as well, it did not emerge as a significant independent predictor for all-cause mortality in a multivariable cox regression analysis.\\nOur finding is particularly intriguing in light of the recent paper by Cortellini, which revealed that the use of glucose-lowering medications, particularly metformin, among patients treated with ICIs, were found to be associated with increased mortality. Those finding may point out the specific beneficial mechanism of SGLT2i, beyond glucose-lowering.\\nOur study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center study and thus generalization of our results is limited. Second, this is a retrospective study; therefore, our results are subject to potential confounders that may be biased by its design. Additionally, because the data was collected retrospectively, there are notable gaps in information on metastatic spread and ECOG stage, therefore not allowing us to adjust for those parameters, aspects that could have had an impact on the outcomes. Third, the lack of routine assessment of cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography among the whole cohort population prevented us from assessing the real cardiotoxicity incidence in our trial. Last, we recognize that the relatively small sample size of the cohort, especially the treatment group, reduces our statistical results and therefore should be taken with caution. Larger prospective trials or meta-analysis are needed to establish our findings and to assess ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity.\\nConclusions\\nSGLT2i therapy was associated with a lower all-cause mortality rate in patients with cancer and DM2 treated with ICIs therapy, in addition to lower events of AF and Myocarditis. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism and evaluate its benefit on CV outcomes.\\nAbbreviations\\nICI\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors\\nSGLT2i\\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors\\nPFS\\nProgression-free survival\\nDM\\nDiabetes mellitus\\nIHD\\nIschemic heart disease\\nPublisherâ\\x80\\x99s Note\\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\\nFunding\\nThe authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nAvailability of data and materials\\nData cannot be shared for ethical/privacy reasons.\\nDeclarations\\nEthics approval and consent to participate\\nThe study was approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Helsinki regulatory ethics committee (Identifier: TLV-0228â\\x80\\x9316)\\nConsent for publication\\nNot applicable.\",\n",
       " 'Immune Responses in Checkpoint Myocarditis Across Heart, Blood, and Tumor\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used anti-cancer therapies that can cause morbid and potentially fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs). ICI-related myocarditis (irMyocarditis) is uncommon but has the highest mortality of any irAE. The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to anti-tumor immunity remain poorly understood. We sought to define immune responses in heart, tumor, and blood during irMyocarditis and identify biomarkers of clinical severity by leveraging single-cell (sc)RNA-seq coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy, and proteomics analysis of 28 irMyocarditis patients and 23 controls. Our analysis of 284,360 cells from heart and blood specimens identified cytotoxic T cells, inflammatory macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and fibroblasts enriched in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Additionally, potentially targetable, pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were upregulated across multiple cell types. TCR clones enriched in heart and paired tumor tissue were largely non-overlapping, suggesting distinct T cell responses within these tissues. We also identify the presence of cardiac-expanded TCRs in a circulating, cycling CD8 T cell population as a novel peripheral biomarker of fatality. Collectively, these findings highlight critical biology driving irMyocarditis and putative biomarkers for therapeutic intervention.\\nIntroduction\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve cancer outcomes for a wide range of tumor types by blocking critical negative regulatory signals in the immune system, but their disruption of peripheral tolerance can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can affect nearly every organ system. Severe irAEs may lead to ICI treatment termination, morbidity, lasting disability, and death. ICI-related Myocarditis (irMyocarditis) occurs in 0.3â\\x80\\x931.7% of ICI recipients yet carries a mortality rate of 20â\\x80\\x9350%, which is the highest of any irAE and 10-fold higher than myocarditis from other causes. Like most irAEs, the molecular underpinnings of irMyocarditis remain poorly understood, which has hampered efforts to design effective risk-stratification, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies. Diagnosis is challenging and commonly requires an endomyocardial biopsy, which is not widely available in most clinical settings and carries significant risks. As there is a lack of prospective therapeutic clinical trial data to inform the management of irMyocarditis, treatment is often guided by expert consensus and extrapolation of data for other conditions, such as cardiac allograft rejection. Emerging non-randomized data has supported the use of more tailored immunosuppressive strategies. However, some immunosuppressive agents, such and corticosteroids and JAK-STAT inhibitors, may be associated with other adverse cardiovascular outcomes and have the potential to counteract anti-tumor immune responses.\\nirMyocarditis is histologically characterized by a patchy, heterogeneous lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the myocardium, which includes both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates. Furthermore, shared T-cell clones were reported in paired myocardium, skeletal muscle, and tumor in a patient with irMyocarditis and ICI-related myositis (irMyositis). Bulk RNA sequencing analysis of myocardial tissue from patients with irMyocarditis demonstrated upregulation of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including CXCL9, MDK, and GBP521. Furthermore, irMyocarditis patients show clonal expansion of circulating CD8+ T cells expressing cytotoxic genes and high levels of inflammatory chemokines. Studies in Pdcd1â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92Ctla4+/â\\x88\\x92 mice, a genetic model of irMyocarditis, demonstrated that effector and proliferating CD8+ T cells in the myocardium were necessary and sufficient to elicit myocarditis, though the fidelity of mouse model systems to human irMyocarditis remains unclear.\\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate four poorly understood aspects of irMyocarditis pathophysiology, which may overlap with other irAEs: (1) the cellular microenvironment in irMyocarditis heart tissue that may drive and sustain disease pathogenesis; (2) the clonal and phenotypic relationship between immune cells in the heart and blood; (3) the degree of T-cell clonal sharing between the heart and paired tumors; and (4) the identity of biomarker candidates that could stratify patients with potentially more severe or fatal irMyocarditis. We leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and paired T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of heart tissue, blood, and tumor to define the cellular phenotype and molecular transcriptional programs associated with irMyocarditis. We found that the myocardial microenvironment is enriched with multiple immune subsets and fibroblasts that upregulate inflammatory genes whose protein products could potentially be targeted by existing immunosuppressive medications. Our study is the first to demonstrate that T cell clonotypes enriched in tumors and heart tissue from irMyocarditis patients are largely distinct. Finally, we identify candidate biomarkers of disease onset, cardiac injury, and fatal irMyocarditis. These findings reveal the cellular and transcriptional changes that underlie irMyocarditis and enable the identification of putative targets for clinical diagnostics and tailored clinical intervention.\\nResults\\nStudy Design and Sample Collection\\nHeart, blood, and tumor specimens were collected from cancer patients with irMyocarditis and ICI-treated controls without irMyocarditis (Figure 1aâ\\x80\\x93c, Methods). Heart tissue for scRNA-seq was collected as part of clinically indicated endomyocardial biopsies in patients with concern for irMyocarditis (n = 15 biopsies; 13 with evidence of irMyocarditis and 2 negative biopsies used as controls) or as part of rapid autopsy collections (n = 4 autopsies; 3 with irMyocarditis and 1 control) (Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 1â\\x80\\x932). Most endomyocardial biopsies were obtained from the right ventricular side of the interventricular septum as part of the clinical evaluation for suspected irMyocarditis, while autopsy samples were obtained by an autopsy pathologist from the right ventricular free wall (Methods). Of the irMyocarditis myocardial samples, 13 were collected before the initiation of corticosteroids; one patient (SIC_264) with fatal irMyocarditis provided one sample from a biopsy prior to the initiation of corticosteroids (denoted â\\x80\\x9cSIC_264_Aâ\\x80\\x9d) and another sample from autopsy after multiple lines of immunosuppression (â\\x80\\x9cSIC_264_Bâ\\x80\\x9d) (Figure 1b). The irMyocarditis patients in our heart scRNA-seq cohort were a median age of 72 years, 80% male, and represented eight primary tumor histologies (Figure 1a, Supplementary Table 1). All patients received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, of which 47% (n = 7) were treated with dual PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition (Supplementary Table 1). Matched heart tissue, tumor, and normal tissues were collected, where possible, from irMyocarditis (n = 6) and ICI-treated control (n = 4) autopsy cases, and these were subsequently used for immunohistochemistry and bulk TCR-Î² sequencing experiments (Figure 1a, 1c, Supplementary Table 3). To evaluate correlations between tissue and blood, we captured both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum for analysis (Figure 1a, 1c). PBMCs were collected from two ICI-treated control patients and 25 irMyocarditis patients: 13 patients included in our heart scRNA-seq dataset and 12 irMyocarditis patients from whom heart scRNA-seq data was not generated (Supplementary Table 4). In these patients, we collected samples prior to the start of corticosteroids for the treatment of irMyocarditis (â\\x80\\x9cpre-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d; n = 18 samples) and after the initiation of corticosteroids (â\\x80\\x9cpost-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d; n = 26 samples) (Supplementary Tables 5, 6). Blood samples from prior to ICI treatment (â\\x80\\x9cpre-ICIâ\\x80\\x9d; n = 7 samples) or after the initiation of ICI but before the emergence of clinical irMyocarditis (â\\x80\\x9con-ICIâ\\x80\\x9d; n = 4 samples) were available through archival biobanking efforts for a subset of cases and were subsequently retrieved (Supplementary Table 6). In total, 55 PBMC specimens across timepoints were collected. Serum for secreted protein analysis was collected from irMyocarditis patients prior to the administration of corticosteroids (n = 16 patients) and ICI-treated control patients without irAEs (n = 10 patients) (Supplementary Table 7).\\nscRNA-seq identifies increased T/NK, mononuclear phagocyte (MNP), and dendritic cells (DCs) in human irMyocarditis heart tissue\\nscRNA-seq analysis of our irMyocarditis heart samples yielded transcriptomes from 33,145 single cells from heart specimens. For additional control samples, we combined our data with six additional heart specimens (total 51,431 cells) from a published heart atlas that profiled donors without cancer and not receiving ICI therapy (Figure 1c). From this heart atlas, we utilized unenriched and CD45+ enriched samples from the right ventricular septum or right ventricular free wall to match the anatomic source of the majority of our irMyocarditis samples. Our integrated dataset included 84,576 single heart cells that passed quality control (QC) and was used for downstream analysis (Methods, Supplementary Table 2). We first employed iterative single-cell clustering strategies to define distinct cell populations. We subsequently leveraged differential abundance, differential gene expression, and cell-cell interaction analyses to identify cellular populations, cellular circuits, and transcriptional programs associated with irMyocarditis across cell lineages, which is further described below.\\nAfter data integration and unsupervised clustering analysis were performed at low resolution to identify all main cell lineages, the clustering analysis was repeated to define all cell subsets present within each lineage (Methods). Nine broad cell lineages were identified in the heart specimens: T and NK cells (characterized by the expression of CD3D and KLRB1), MNPs (CD14, CD68), DCs (CD1C, CLEC9A, IRF8), B cells and plasmablasts (CD79A, MZB1), endothelial cells (VWF, CA4), mural cells (RGS5, KCNJ8), fibroblasts (DCN, PDGFRA), cardiomyocytes (TNNI3, MB), and neuronal cells (PLP1, NRXN1) (Figure 1câ\\x80\\x93d, Supplementary Figure 1a, Supplementary Table 8). Samples from our dataset and the published heart atlas contributed to each lineage (Supplementary Figure 1b) and to the 32 cell subsets defined through the subclustering of each cell lineage (Supplementary Table 9).\\nGiven prior reports that corticosteroids can reverse the inflammatory processes of irAEs and decrease circulating inflammatory proteins in irAE patients, our abundance analyses compared irMyocarditis samples collected prior to the administration of corticosteroids (â\\x80\\x9cpre-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d samples, n = 12) to control samples (n = 8) to define the cellular populations associated with disease. At the lineage level, this analysis showed an increase in the T/NK lineage (OR 6.8; 95% CI 2.4 â\\x80\\x93 19.2; p = 8.1e-4) and MNP lineage (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.1 â\\x80\\x93 10.9; p = 0.040) in irMyocarditis cases (Figure 1d, Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Table 10). Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were also more abundant in irMyocarditis (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.2 â\\x80\\x93 16.1; p = 0.048). Trends towards increased fibroblasts (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.2 â\\x80\\x93 7.8; p = 0.065) and decreased mural cells (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.22 â\\x80\\x93 0.96; p = 0.052) in irMyocarditis samples were also observed. Similar to histologic reports of irMyocarditis, we identified few intracardiac B cells/plasmablasts (n = 169 cells across cases and controls); since this lineage was rare and not enriched in irMyocarditis, they were not analyzed further.\\nMicroscopic tumor deposits are found in some patients with irMyocarditis\\nBeyond these shifts in cellular abundance associated with disease, we also found that two patients with irMyocarditis had evidence of viable tumor in the myocardium at autopsy, representing a potential driver of local inflammatory responses. One patient had a solitary lesion (SIC_136, melanoma), while the other had diffuse tumor deposits throughout the myocardial tissue (SIC_232, renal cell carcinoma); in both cases, there was inflammation both adjacent to and remote from the metastases (Figure 1e). A third patient with metastatic melanoma and irMyocarditis who had received prior targeted therapy before dual checkpoint inhibition (SIC_171) had evidence of melanin-laden macrophages on endomyocardial biopsy, suggesting prior intracardiac melanoma (data not shown). While microscopic metastases in the setting of a suspected irAE have been described in the gut, intracardiac tumor deposits in the vicinity of irMyocarditis previously have not been reported. While we did not find evidence of viable tumor cells in our scRNA-seq data, these histological findings suggest that inflammation against intracardiac tumors may contribute to myocardial inflammation in a subset of patients who present with irMyocarditis.\\nscRNA-seq of blood identifies circulating immune cell populations that correlate with irMyocarditis severity\\nPBMCs were profiled using scRNA-seq, paired TCR, and surface proteomics using the CITE-seq protocol for 197 surface proteins (Supplementary Table 11) to identify peripheral blood correlates of irMyocarditis and disease severity as well as to examine the relationship between irAE tissue and blood. Blood samples were obtained over multiple time points from 25 patients (n = 55 total samples) who developed irMyocarditis and two ICI-treated control patients who never developed irMyocarditis (Supplementary Figure 1d, Supplementary Table 4). Unsupervised clustering of 232,929 cells that passed QC filters (Methods) identified all known blood immune cell lineages, defined by canonical markers: CD8 T cells and NK cells (CD3D, CD8A, KLRF1); CD4 T cells (CD3D, CD4); MNPs (LYZ, CD14); DCs, representing both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (LILRA4) and cDCs (CD1C, CLEC9A); and B and plasmablast cells (CD79A, JCHAIN) (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure 1e, Supplementary Tables 6, 9, and 12).\\nWe then sought to identify populations in the blood associated with irMyocarditis disease severity by investigating the relationship between the circulating frequency of each lineage and serum troponin levels, a widely used clinical measure that is associated with poor outcomes in irMyocarditis. The peripheral abundance of MNPs was directly correlated with serum troponin (p = 0.001), while CD4 T cells (p = 0.024) and CD8 T/NK cells (p = 0.003), and B/plasmablast cells (p = 0.039) were inversely correlated (Supplementary Figure 1f, Supplementary Table 16). These findings are consistent with previous reports of lymphopenia in the setting of irMyocarditis but provide greater granularity to nominate novel peripheral blood correlates of irAE disease severity.\\nActivated CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells are increased in irMyocarditis\\nIn order to further understand the nature of the T cells present in irMyocarditis heart tissue, we subclustered the 9,134 cells in the intracardiac T/NK lineage. We annotated cell subtypes by using marker genes (i.e., area under the curve [AUC] â\\x89¥ 0.75, one-vs-all [OVA] pseudobulk false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Methods, Supplementary Table 8) and cross-referencing marker genes with published immune transcriptional signatures. Throughout the text, immune cell subsets found in heart tissue are denoted by subset names that begin with â\\x80\\x9ch-â\\x80\\x9d, while subsets in blood begin with â\\x80\\x9cb-â\\x80\\x9d. Within the T/NK lineage, we defined six distinct cell subsets, including four CD8 T, one CD4 T (cluster 3, h-CD4TIL7R,LTB), and one NK cell subset (cluster 1, h-NKKLRF1,FCER1G) (Figure 2aâ\\x80\\x93c, Supplementary Table 9). All CD8 T cell subsets broadly expressed markers of cytotoxicity (e.g., GZMK and CCL5) and cell adhesion (e.g., ITGB7) (Figure 2d). Two CD8 T cell subsets â\\x80\\x93 cluster 2 (h-CD8TCD27,LAG3), which is defined by the expression of CD27 and LAG3, and cluster 6 (h-CD8Tcycling), which is defined by a cycling cell signature (e.g., STMN1, TOP2A) â\\x80\\x93 expressed a spectrum of activation and exhaustion markers (e.g., CTLA4, PDCD1, and TOX) as well as the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Cluster 4 (h-CD8TCCL5,NKG7) captured a CD8 T cell population expressing CCL5 and NKG7 and also included a small group of cycling cells with lower expression of exhaustion markers like LAG3 and TOX. Finally, cluster 5 (h-CD8TKLRG1,CX3CR1) comprises CD8 T cells distinctly expressing KLRG1 and CX3CR1, which are markers known to define short-lived effector cells. Amongst these T cell subsets, h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 (OR 5.8; 95% CI 1.3 â\\x80\\x93 26.3; p = 0.03), h-CD8TCCL5,NKG7 (OR 19.0; 95% CI 6.0 â\\x80\\x93 60.0; p = 5.1e-05), and h-CD4TIL7R,LTB (OR 6.0; 95% CI: 1.8 â\\x80\\x93 20.1; p = 0.0091) were more abundant in irMyocarditis cases than controls, while h-CD8Tcycling displayed a trend towards greater abundance (OR 11.7; 95% CI 1.3 â\\x80\\x93 104.0; p = 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 2aâ\\x80\\x93b, Supplementary Table 10). Although our scRNA-seq analyses of the heart were underpowered to compare fatal and non-fatal cases, we used serum troponin as a marker of disease severity and found that the intracardiac frequency of the h-CD8Tcycling subset correlated with serum troponin (p = 0.018) (Figure 2e, Supplementary Table 17). Marker genes that defined h-CD4TIL7R,LTB include a mixture of naive (CCR7 and MAL), regulatory (IL2RA and FOXP3), and memory (LTB and FLT3LG) CD4 T cells, but given the small number of cells in the h-CD4TIL7R,LTB subset (n = 1,401 cells), further subsetting analysis was not explored.\\nImmunosuppression alters T-cell gene expression but not TCR repertoire in an irMyocarditis case with matched pre- and post-corticosteroid heart samples\\nWhile immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and abatacept are used to treat irMyocarditis, there is no evidence as to how these agents impact immune cell populations or transcriptional programs that persist despite immunosuppressive treatments. Clinical opportunities to investigate paired pre-corticosteroid and post-corticosteroid heart samples are rare, but they could help to shape the interpretation of data collected from post-corticosteroid samples in our study and irAE efforts that similarly leverage autopsy samples. We analyzed a single patient (SIC_264) with fatal irMyocarditis who provided both a pre-corticosteroid biopsy specimen (SIC_264_A) and a second sample (SIC_264_B) obtained at autopsy after the administration of high dose corticosteroids (a total of 6 g methylprednisolone over seven days) and abatacept (10 mg/kg administered two days prior to autopsy) (Figure 1b). Across these two samples, the top 13 most expanded TCR clones were found in both timepoints, suggesting that the most predominant TCR-Î² sequences remain similar before and after immunosuppressive treatment in the setting of persistent irMyocarditis (Supplementary Figure 2câ\\x80\\x93d). However, gene expression profiles of the cells carrying these TCR-Î² sequences appear to change post-corticosteroid treatment. Prior to the initiation of corticosteroids, these expanded TCR-Î² clones were predominantly mapped to CD8 T cells expressing cycling markers (e.g. STMN1) in the h-CD8Tcycling and h-CD8TCCL5,NKG7 subsets (Supplementary Figure 2dâ\\x80\\x93e). At the time of death, seven days later, these expanded TCR-Î² clones were chiefly mapped to h-CD8TCD27,LAG3, which express activation markers but do not express a cycling signature (Figure 2d, Supplementary Figure 2dâ\\x80\\x93e). These observations suggest the possibility that immunosuppression alters the cellular phenotype and transcriptional profile of T cells even if they do not dramatically alter the predominant TCR clones in the setting of treatment-resistant irMyocarditis. This observation provided further justification for utilizing only pre-corticosteroid samples for our differential gene expression and abundance analyses. Nonetheless, given that no notable changes post-corticosteroid were observed across the top expanded TCR clones, the post-corticosteroid samples were kept in downstream TCR repertoire analyses.\\nT cells in irMyocarditis show transcriptional signatures consistent with increased immunoreceptor signaling, interferon response, and motility\\nTo identify transcriptional programs present in intracardiac T and NK cells, we performed differential gene expression analysis comparing irMyocarditis cases versus controls at the level of T cell lineage (â\\x80\\x9cAll Tâ\\x80\\x9d cells) and for each of the defined subsets. As T cells in the uninflamed heart are rare, we included in the analysis ICI-treated controls without irMyocarditis from MGH (n = 2), as well as the native and CD45+ enriched samples from non-ICI-treated controls (n = 6). Significant upregulation (FDR<0.1) of transcriptional programs associated with MHC class II presentation (CD74, HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB5), immunoreceptor signaling (LCP2, LIME1, PAK2, NR4A3, EGR2, TOX), and interferon responses (GBP5, IFITM1, STAT1) were seen across multiple subsets (Figure 2fâ\\x80\\x93g, Supplementary Table 14). Additionally, inflammasome genes (CNPY3, NLRC3) were upregulated across all T cell subsets and NK cells. In the h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 cells, upregulation of multiple immune checkpoints (CTLA4 and LAG3) were observed. Other genes involved in cell migration and adhesion, such as ITGA4 in the h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 subset, were also increased in irMyocarditis cases.\\nTCR clones enriched in irMyocarditis hearts are distinct from those enriched in tumor\\nWe next sought to assess TCR clonality in irMyocarditis myocardial tissue and to characterize their relationship to TCR clones present in tumor tissue from the same patients after ICI treatment. Bulk TCR-Î² sequencing allows for deeper sequencing of the TCR-Î² repertoire than single-cell (sc)TCR-seq (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 3, Methods). Of the six patients without diffuse myocardial metastases, the heart tissues were classified by a cardiac pathologist as â\\x80\\x9cactive myocarditisâ\\x80\\x9d (n = 2; SIC_17 and SIC_264), lymphocytic infiltrate without associated myocyte injury suggestive of irMyocarditis (â\\x80\\x9cborderlineâ\\x80\\x9d; n = 1; SIC_136), â\\x80\\x9chealing myocarditisâ\\x80\\x9d (n = 3; SIC_3, SIC_175, and SIC_266), or no evidence of myocarditis/control (n = 4) according to the Dallas Criteria. Areas of interest were dissected on serial FFPE sections, and gDNA was extracted for bulk TCR-Î² sequencing (Methods). As expected, irMyocarditis tissues yielded more TCR-Î² sequences per total nucleated cells (control mean 0.9%Â±0.6 SD vs irMyocarditis mean 17.7%Â±14.5 SD; p = 0.00023) (Supplementary Figure 3a). To compare the TCR-Î² diversity of our irMyocarditis tissue repertoires, we used Hillâ\\x80\\x99s diversity index across different diversity orders to capture both the true richness (low q value) and abundance (high q value) of the samples (Figure 3b). Notably, the two â\\x80\\x9cactiveâ\\x80\\x9d irMyocarditis cases had the lowest diversity across all orders, and the TCR-Î² repertoire from these two patients each demonstrated expansion of primary dominant clones that comprised >40% of the recovered irMyocarditis TCR-Î² repertoire (Supplementary Figure 3bâ\\x80\\x93c).\\nAs prior reports have suggested TCR sharing between irMyocarditis heart tissue and autologous tumor, we compared the TCR-Î² repertoires in irMyocarditis heart to autologous tumors. To account for ubiquitous, circulating â\\x80\\x9cbystanderâ\\x80\\x9d T cells and resident T-cell populations in normal parenchyma that had been invaded by tumors, we also analyzed the TCR-Î² repertoire of normal tissue adjacent to tumors (available from four donors) to establish a common control tissue against which the heart and tumor tissue could be compared (Methods). We considered TCR-Î²s to be enriched in the tumor or heart if they were expanded in either of those tissues relative to the TCR-Î² frequency in the matched normal control tissue. Heart-enriched TCR-Î² clones were recovered from all four donors with irMyocarditis (range 1â\\x80\\x939 per donor; total 19 clones), while tumor-enriched clones were found in three of these four donors (range 0â\\x80\\x9317; total 28 clones). Across all irMyocarditis patients, five clones were enriched in both heart and tumor (18% of tumor-enriched TCR-Î²s, 26% of heart-enriched TCR-Î²s), but in each irMyocarditis patients, the TCR-Î² clones most expanded in heart tissue compared to control tissue were not enriched in the tumor relative to control tissue (Figure 3câ\\x80\\x93d, Supplementary Figure 3dâ\\x80\\x93e, Supplementary table 18). In sum, these data suggest that there exists a modest overlap of TCR-Î² clones between heart and tumor, but the majority of the enriched TCR-Î² clones and the most expanded clones in each tissue are distinct.\\nFatal irMyocarditis is associated with cycling CD8 T cells in the blood that express TCRs expanded in intracardiac T cells\\nWe next examined if TCR-Î² clones enriched in irMyocarditis heart tissue could also be detected among circulating CD8 T cells, which would suggest that intracardiac T cells may have emigrated from clonally related populations in blood. We subclustered 75,480 CD8 T/NK cells from our peripheral blood dataset and identified 12 distinct cell subsets (Figure 3eâ\\x80\\x93f, Supplementary Figure 4a, Supplementary Table 9). We combined our heart single-cell data with TCR-Î² sequence data yielded from the analysis of bulk tissue (Figure 3a) from patients with â\\x80\\x9cactiveâ\\x80\\x9d (SIC_17, SIC_264) or â\\x80\\x9cborderlineâ\\x80\\x9d irMyocarditis (SIC_136) (Supplementary Figure 3b). Across all patients, logistic regression analysis showed statistically significant sharing of TCR-Î² sequences between the heart and five blood CD8 T subsets (Supplementary Figure 4bâ\\x80\\x93c). However, there were striking differences in heart/blood TCR sharing seen across specific CD8 T cell subsets on a per-patient basis (Figure 3gâ\\x80\\x93h, Supplementary Figure 4d). Three of four fatal irMyocarditis patients had statistically significant sharing of heart-expanded TCR-Î² clones in the circulating b-CD8Tcycling cells while only one of nine patients with non-fatal irMyocarditis had significant sharing in this subset (p = 0.052 for this comparison by Fisherâ\\x80\\x99s exact test). b-CD8Tcycling is defined by expression of CXCR3, cycling genes (MKI67, STMN1), and CD45RO surface protein, indicating that these are antigen-exposed and dividing cells (Figure 3i). The only patient with fatal irMyocarditis who did not share clones between the heart and the circulating b-CD8Tcycling subset was a patient with diffuse tumor deposits in the heart (SIC_232). We then sought to identify where the expanded heart TCR-Î² clones mapped across the intracardiac T-cell subsets; of the cases with >10 intracardiac T cells sharing clones between heart and blood, shared TCRs predominantly mapped to CXCR3-expressing subsets in a fatal case (SIC_264) and to CX3CR1-expressing subsets in three non-fatal cases (Supplementary Figure 4eâ\\x80\\x93f). These results suggest that the phenotypes of T cells found shared between the heart and blood may risk-stratify patients with irMyocarditis and shed light on circulating blood CD8 T cells that may contribute to disease pathogenesis.\\nWe then sought to perform similar analysis in blood CD4 T cells. We subclustered 33,313 blood CD4 T cells and identified six distinct cell subsets (Supplementary Figure 5aâ\\x80\\x93c, Supplementary Tables 9, 13). In contrast to circulating CD8 T cells, there was minimal TCR-Î² sharing between blood and intracardiac CD4 T cells. No patient had more than ten blood CD4 T cells sharing a TCR-Î² with an expanded intracardiac T cell clone (data not shown).\\ncDC enrichment in irMyocarditis hearts is associated with disease severity\\nWe next investigated intracardiac mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) populations. Unsupervised clustering of 9,824 cells yielded seven unique populations: five distinct MNP subsets, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Figure 4aâ\\x80\\x93c, Supplementary Table 9). Expression of LYVE1 and C1QA distinguished one MNP subset (cluster 2), which likely represents cardiac resident macrophages. MNP cluster 3 expressed FCGR3A, and the immune checkpoint molecules LILRB1 and LILRB2, which confer inhibitory signals to MNPs (Figure 4b, 4d). Additional MNP populations were characterized by the expression of S100A8, S100A12, and VCAN (cluster 4), and the expression of TREM2 and APOC1 (cluster 5) (Figure 4b). Among cDCs (cluster 6, defined by CLEC9A and CD1C expression), a subset expressed FLT3, which is a critical homeostatic signal for DC maintenance (Figure 4d). There were too few h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C detected to further subcluster these cells into cDC1 (CLEC9A) and cDC2 (CD1C), though we noted that the majority of h-cDCs CLEC9A,CD1C observed expressed CD1C (Figure 4d). Multiple chemokine receptors were expressed across intracardiac MNP populations. The chemokine receptor CXCR4, which controls DC activation and localization, was highly expressed by h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C, h-pDCsLILRA4, IRF8, and a fraction of h-MNPFCGR3A,LILRB2, h-MNPS100A12,VCAN, and h-MNPTREM2,APOC1. CCR2, which supports monocyte recruitment early after cardiac injury , was expressed only by a small fraction of hMNPFCGR3A,LILRB2 and h-MNPS100A12,VCAN. CX3CR1, which has been shown to attenuate the severity of viral myocarditis  and is expressed by murine cardiac macrophages , was lowly expressed in a subset of the h-MNPFCGR3A,LILRB2 population. Two MNP subsets, h-MNPS100A8-low,C1QA-low (cluster 1; OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.3 â\\x80\\x93 18.1; p = 0.044) and h-MNPFCGR3A,LILRB2 (cluster 3; OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.2 â\\x80\\x93 9.3; p = 0.041), and h-cDCs CLEC9A,CD1C (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.1 â\\x80\\x93 11.9; p = 0.064) were more abundant in irMyocarditis versus control hearts (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure 6aâ\\x80\\x93b, Supplementary Table 10). We recovered only 43 pDCs (cluster 7, defined by LILRA4 and IRF8), and while h-pDCsLILRA4,IRF8 may be more abundant in irMyocarditis cases (cluster 7; OR 4.34 Ã\\x97 107; CI 97.46â\\x80\\x931.93 Ã\\x97 1013; p = 0.018), such a low recovery does not allow us to confidently assess these differences.\\nWe then sought to validate the increased abundance of cDCs in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Using autopsy samples, histologic sections of ICI-treated control heart tissue and irMyocarditis heart tissue were stained for the cDC marker CD1c, and CD1c+ cells were quantified using digital imaging software to highlight stained candidate cDCs, followed by manual validation (Figure 4e, Methods). Across whole slides, irMyocarditis tissue showed a trend towards increased CD1c+ cell density compared to control tissue (22.9Â±35.0 vs 2.5Â±2.1 CD1c+ cells per 105 total cells; p = 0.11) (Supplementary Figure 6c, Supplementary Table 19). However, areas of inflammation in irMyocarditis hearts had more than 16-fold greater density of CD1c+ cells than control tissue (41.3Â±48.2 vs 2.5Â±2.1; p = 0.053) (Supplementary Figure 6d) and a 2.8-fold greater density of CD1c+ cells than non-inflamed regions of irMyocarditis hearts (41.3Â±48.2 vs 14.9Â±20.5; p = 0.043) (Figure 4f). Collectively, these IHC data support the finding from scRNA-seq data that cDCs are increased in areas of inflammation in irMyocarditis.\\nGiven the observation of increased abundance of cDCs in irMyocarditis heart tissue, we investigated whether the frequencies of intracardiac MNP subsets were associated with irMyocarditis severity as measured by serum troponin. While h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C frequency was found to be correlated with serum troponin (p = 0.013) (Figure 4g), similar relationships were not seen with the two other MNP populations enriched in irMyocarditis tissue (i.e., h-MNPS100A8-low, C1QA-low and h-MNPFCGR3A, LILRB2; Supplementary Table 17).\\nMNPs in irMyocarditis show transcriptional changes involved in antigen presentation, T cell activation, and immune cell recruitment\\nBeyond a shift in population abundance, several transcriptional programs were upregulated in irMyocarditis versus control tissue across multiple MNP subsets (Figure 4hâ\\x80\\x93i, Supplementary Table 14). This included genes related to antigen presentation, such as MHC class I (HLA-C) and MHC class II (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2) programs, as well as the proteasome subunit beta type-9 (PSMB9), an interferon-inducible component of the immunoproteasome. Additionally, the immune checkpoint molecule HLA-G was upregulated in several MNP subsets. Genes encoding CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 were upregulated in a subset of MNPs and at the pseudobulk level across all MNP subsets. Furthermore, all MNP subsets and h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C showed increased expression levels of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). For example, consistent with a prior report, the interferon-inducible inflammasome activator GBP5 was increased in irMyocarditis, along with ISGs such as IFITM1 and RARRES3. Finally, irMyocarditis samples demonstrated increased expression of the key mediator of cytokine signaling and transcription factor STAT1. Collectively, multiple transcriptional programs related to T cell activation and interferon responses were upregulated in the setting of irMyocarditis.\\nFibroblasts are enriched in irMyocarditis heart tissue\\nGiven stromal cells such as endothelial cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts play crucial roles in orchestrating cardiac immune responses, we next investigated the contribution of the non-immune cell component captured in our heart data to irMyocarditis. Subclustering of scRNA-seq data from 65,409 cells yielded 17 distinct non-immune subsets (excluding doublets and RBCs): eight endothelial populations, three pericyte populations, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endocardial cells, neuronal cells, and cardiomyocytes (Figure 5aâ\\x80\\x93b, Supplementary Figure 7aâ\\x80\\x93b, Supplementary Table 9, Methods). Within the endothelial cell compartment, there were three capillary endothelial cell populations distinguished by CA4 expression, two arterial endothelial cell populations characterized by HEY1 expression, a population of inflammatory endothelial cells expressing multiple ISGs, such as GBP5 and IFITM1, a venous endothelial population expressing marker ACKR1, and lymphatic endothelial cells distinguished by PDPN and CCL21 expression. Amongst all non-immune subsets, only fibroblasts (defined by expression of DCN and LUM) were more enriched in irMyocarditis tissue (cluster 4; OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.5 â\\x80\\x93 9.7; p = 0.042) (Figure 5c, Supplementary Figure 7câ\\x80\\x93d, Supplementary Table 10). Multiple subsets were less abundant in irMyocarditis: Capillary ECRGCC,CA4 (cluster 1; OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23 â\\x80\\x93 0.69; p = 0.0061), Capillary ECCXCL2,JUN (cluster 2; OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 â\\x80\\x93 0.98; p = 0.063), Arterial ECHEY1,SEMA3G (cluster 5; OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21 â\\x80\\x93 0.88; p =0.037), Arterial ECRBP7,BTNL9 (cluster 9; OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.13 â\\x80\\x93 0.64; p = 0.0064), smooth muscle cells (cluster 8; OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 â\\x80\\x93 0.75; p = 0.0097), and PericytesKCNJ8,ABCC9 (cluster 7; OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.27 â\\x80\\x93 0.91; p = 0.038). In sum, fibroblasts were uniquely enriched in irMyocarditis among all non-immune populations. The decrease in relative frequency of other non-immune populations (among all total measured intracardiac cells) may be due to the infiltration of immune cells in the setting of irMyocarditis.\\nStromal cell populations upregulate the expression of transcriptional programs involved in immune cell activation and recruitment\\nDifferential gene expression analysis comparing irMyocarditis to control tissue demonstrated upregulation of 654 unique genes with FDR<0.1 in at least one stromal cell subset (Figure 5d, Supplementary Table 14). Unexpectedly, two pericyte subsets, one characterized by HLA-DRB1 and S1PR1 expression (cluster 6) and PericytesKCNJ8,ABCC9 had the highest number of upregulated genes (396 and 563 genes, respectively). Multiple genes involved in antigen presentation, including CD74 and HLA-DPB1, were upregulated across multiple non-immune cell subsets in irMyocarditis cases compared to controls (Figure 5e). The expression levels of numerous cytokines and chemokines were also increased in stromal cells across cases. For example, expression of some or all of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were increased in each of the Capillary ECRGCC,CA4 (cluster 1), Capillary ECCXCL2,JUN (cluster 2), venous EC, and fibroblasts subsets (Figure 5eâ\\x80\\x93f). Midkine (MDK), a cytokine with a defined role in T cell activation, was broadly upregulated across many endothelial and mural cell subsets. FLT3LG, the ligand for the FLT3 cytokine receptor and a key regulator of DC mobilization and function, was increased across several EC subsets, mural cell subsets, and in fibroblasts. Expression of transcription factor STAT1, which is key in inducing the transcription of ISGs, was increased in multiple populations, analogous to observations in lymphoid and MNP populations.\\nCell-cell communication analysis nominates interactions involved in immune cell recruitment, activation, and retention to heart tissue\\nThe interactions between immune and stromal cells in irMyocarditis represent a potentially under-explored opportunity to understand disease biology and identify therapeutic targets for mitigating irMyocarditis. We leveraged CellPhoneDB to explore intracellular interactions and focused on genes in ligand-receptor pairs where (a) one gene in the pair was differentially expressed in irMyocarditis heart tissue and (b) one cell subset expressing either the ligand or receptor was more abundant in irMyocarditis heart tissue (Methods). Results were manually curated for interactions that were supported by published literature to generate a final list of 92 unique receptor:ligand pairs and 1,069 subset-specific interactions (Figure 5g, Supplementary Table 20). PericytesHLA-DRB1,S1PR1 and PericytesKCNJ8,ABCC9 had the most predicted intercellular interactions, with a total of 116 interactions and 93 interactions across the eight cell populations enriched in irMyocarditis heart tissue, respectively. Endothelial subsets, fibroblasts, and MNP subsets each upregulated the expression of genes involved in the recruitment, activation, and retention of immune cells into irMyocarditis tissue (Supplementary Table 14). For example, FLT3 expressed on h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C is predicted to interact with FLT3LG expressed by fibroblasts and may be involved in the increased number of cDCs in irMyocarditis tissue, particularly in areas of active inflammation (Figure 4c, 4f, 5f, 5h far left). Stromal cell subsets may also play a role in the attracting and retaining T cells in heart tissue. For example, h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 cells are enriched in irMyocarditis and express the receptor CXCR3 (Figure 2câ\\x80\\x93d, 5h left), which is also found on the circulating b-CD8Tcycling cells associated with fatal irMyocarditis (Figure 3hâ\\x80\\x93i). Our analysis predicts that these CXCR3-expressing CD8T cells may interact with venous ECs and other stromal cell subsets expressing CXCL9 (Figure 5f). h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 cells also express the integrins ITGA4 (Figure 2g, 5h right) and ITGAL (Figure 5h far right), which are expected to interact with VCAM1 on fibroblasts and ICAM1 on PericytesKCNJ8,ABCC9, respectively. These results suggest that the stromal cells in the heart may play an under-explored role in the pathophysiology of irMyocarditis.\\nIncreased levels of immunomodulatory factors are found in the blood of in irMyocarditis patients\\nBased on our results showing increased expression of genes encoding soluble inflammatory mediators in our MNP and stromal subsets in irMyocarditis, we investigated circulating levels of these immunomodulatory proteins. We analyzed serum from patients with irMyocarditis prior to treatment with corticosteroids (n = 16) and from ICI-treated patients without irAEs (n = 10) using a 71-analyte panel (Methods). Among these 71 examined factors, 16 were increased in the irMyocarditis samples (p < 0.05) (Figure 5i, Supplementary Table 21). These included CCL21 (also known as â\\x80\\x9c6Ckine,â\\x80\\x9d p = 0.046), which is known to recruit T cells, B cells, and DCs into lymphoid organs. Chemokines CXCL9 (p = 0.040) and CXCL10 (IP10, p = 0.013), which mediate chemotaxis through their receptor CXCR3, were increased in serum of patients with irMyocarditis, and their transcripts were found to be upregulated in several non-immune cell populations (Figure 5eâ\\x80\\x93f). Noteworthy, the receptor for these molecules, CXCR3, is expressed on b-CD8Tcycling cells (within which sharing of TCR clones found in irMyocarditis heart tissue correlated with fatal irMyocarditis) (Figure 3f), h-CD8TCD27,LAG3 cells, and h-CD8Tcycling cells (Figure 2d). Levels of TNFÎ± (p = 0.034), which was also differentially expressed by h-MNPTREM2,APOC1 cells in irMyocarditis tissue (Figure 4h), IFN-Î³ (p = 0.025), and IL-12p40 (p = 0.004) were all upregulated in cases. Interestingly, these three cytokines are each targeted by agents that are commercially available and FDA-approved for the treatment of auto-immune diseases. Additional factors with increased serum levels in irMyocarditis included IL-2 (p = 0.021), IL-15 (p = 0.003), IL-18 (p = 0.038), and IL-27 (p = 0.003), all of which support and direct T cell activation (Figure 5i).\\nDiscussion\\nICIs are a widely used class of cancer therapeutics that have demonstrated life-saving activity across a range of tumor types, but they have the potential to cause morbid and potentially fatal irAEs, such as irMyocarditis. Partly because severe irAEs may not be faithfully recapitulated in the murine tumor models used to study ICI efficacy, the pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to anti-tumor immunity remains poorly characterized. We present the first systems-based approach and in-depth analysis of paired heart, blood, and tumor to report the first comprehensive, high-resolution study of the immune responses across tissue compartments that define irMyocarditis in patients. Our key findings are summarized in Figure 6. Our results indicate that irMyocarditis hearts are enriched for multiple CD8 T cell and MNP subsets, CD4 T cells, cDCs, and fibroblasts. Multiple transcriptional programs are activated in the setting of irMyocarditis, including those involved in interferon signaling, cell trafficking, antigen presentation, and immune cell activation. Sequencing of TCRs demonstrated that the clones most enriched relative to control tissue in the heart and in autologous tumors were largely non-overlapping, suggesting that distinct antigens drive T-cell activity in these two tissues. Multiple novel biomarkers of irMyocarditis severity were identified: heart-expanded T cell clones disproportionately shared with circulating b-CD8Tcycling cells in fatal cases and correlations between intracardiac h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C and h-CD8Tcycling populations and serum troponin. Multiple soluble factors were found at increased levels in the serum of irMyocarditis patients, including several targeted by approved therapeutics.\\nWhile we were able to discern clear and consistent biological signals across all patients in our study, the patchy nature of the disease, tissue availability, and limited ICI-treated controls are limitations of our study. irMyocarditis is histologically heterogeneous, often with relatively small regions of inflammation interspersed within otherwise normal-appearing myocardium. The distinction between irMyocarditis cases and controls in our scRNA-seq analysis was based on the histologic finding of irMyocarditis in that patient, confirmed by a pathologist; however, endomyocardial biopsies provide scant tissue that needed to be processed immediately and in its entirety to generate scRNA-seq data, which makes it impossible to determine how the tissue used for scRNA-seq captured the patchy nature of irMyocarditis. Autopsy samples provide ample tissue, but these patients are almost always heavily treated with immunosuppressive agents that alter gene expression profiles. Additionally, since biopsies are typically performed only in the setting of high clinical suspicion and with evidence of cardiac dysfunction, ICI-treated control samples are rarely available, have few immune cells, and may have non-inflammatory cardiac disease. We leveraged a published heart atlas to account for some of these factors, but we were underpowered to compare fatal to non-fatal irMyocarditis tissue samples and may not be able to detect various endotypes of irMyocarditis.\\nDespite these limitations, our study recapitulates findings from prior histopathological analyses and builds a more detailed cellular and molecular understanding of irMyocarditis in cancer patients. Prior work has shown that irMyocarditis tissue is characterized by infiltrating T cells and macrophages. Beyond validating the enrichment of these populations, our scRNA-seq analysis further defined the cellular phenotypes of the enriched CD4 T cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and multiple MNP subsets in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Additionally, we identified an increase in cDCs and found that the presence of h-cDCsCLEC9A,CD1C and h-CD8Tcycling correlate with circulating troponin, a clinical measure of myocardial damage. Our study is also the first to deeply profile stromal cells in irMyocarditis. We found that endothelial, fibroblast, and pericyte populations have increased expression of genes that could play a role in the recruitment, activation, and retention of immune cells into the heart. Collectively, our data supports a pathophysiologic model of irMyocarditis in which potentially auto-reactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells and antigen presenting cells are both recruited to and retained in the heart by stromal and immune-cell signaling networks.\\nThe identity of the antigen (or antigens) driving cardiac T-cells responses in irMyocarditis remains unclear, as is whether the same antigen drives anti-tumor immunity in these patients. A seminal case report of irMyocarditis found common expanded TCR sequences in irMyocarditis tissue and tumor, supporting the potential for shared antigens in tumor and irAEs that has been subsequently explored in irAEs affecting the skin and lungs. It is possible that irMyocarditis may be pathophysiologically or antigenically heterogeneous; indeed, some of our irMyocarditis cases had evidence of clinically occult cardiac metastases in biopsy or autopsy samples, which could play a role in initiating, sustaining, or mimicking irMyocarditis. However, in each of our four cases without diffuse cardiac metastases, we utilized control tissues to account for potentially ubiquitous, non-specific â\\x80\\x9cbystanderâ\\x80\\x9d TCR clones, and we found that the TCR clonotypes most enriched in hearts and autologous tumors relative to control tissues were distinct. Though the antigens recognized by these TCRs are presently unknown and disparate TCR sequences can be specific for the same antigen, our findings of different enriched clonotypes in the heart and tumor within each patient argue against a common antigen driving the immune responses at both sites. The cardiac protein Î±-myosin (encoded by MYH6) has been reported as an auto-antigen in mouse models of irMyocarditis, and Î±-myosin-specific T cells are also found in the blood and heart of irMyocarditis patients. Notably, however, Î±-myosin-reactive T-cell clones were reported in the blood of every healthy control donor and were not the most expanded clones recovered from irMyocarditis tissue. Further investigation into antigenic drivers and mediators of inflammation in irMyocarditis and tumor are needed to better define the relationship between T-cell responses in these different microenvironments. These studies may also clarify why only approximately 1% of ICI recipients develop irMyocarditis despite the high prevalence of T-cell clones specific for Î±-myosin, which could help to identify cancer patients at risk for developing irMyocarditis.\\nAcross our cohort, the analysis of blood and paired tissue yielded insights into the pathology of irMyocarditis and nominated biomarkers that could be used to design new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We observed a positive correlation between MNP cells in blood serum troponin with a corresponding inverse correlation between serum troponin and the frequencies of CD4 T cells, CD8 T/NK cells, and B/plasma cells. Patients with fatal irMyocarditis were also more likely to share heart-expanded TCR clonotypes within a circulating, CD8 T population expressing CXCR3 and MKI67 (b-CD8Tcycling). Secreted factor analysis found that irMyocarditis patients had increased levels of chemokines (CCL21, CXCL9, and CXCL10), targetable inflammatory mediators (TNFÎ±, IFN-Î³, and IL-12p40), and T-cell supporting cytokines (IL-2, IL-15, IL-18, and IL-27) compared to ICI-treated controls.\\nOur efforts also help to contextualize irMyocarditis within the emerging literature of irAEs impacting other organs and distinct inflammatory conditions impacting the heart. While irAEs in barrier organs, such as the colon, may be driven by both resident and recruited immune cells, it appears as though irAEs in sterile organs such as the heart and joints are driven by immune cell recruitment. Many efforts to study irAEs across affected tissues have implicated CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL9/10/11 in the recruitment of immune cells into various tissues. This chemokine system is important for antitumor responses in the tumor microenvironment, and while these ligands are increased in the blood of all patients receiving ICIs, it is tempting to speculate that the degree of elevation can distinguish irAEs and even the severity of irAEs, such as fatal irMyocarditis. Despite these similarities, differences are observed in organ-specific irAE studies, such as Th17 signals reported in irArthritis and irColitis that are absent in our data. Organ-specific differences may also explain why some immunosuppressive agents may be helpful in some irAEs but harmful in others; for instance, TNF-Î± inhibitors have shown efficacy in irColitis but may be detrimental in irMyocarditis. We are the first to show the direct presence of cDCs in irAEs, but RNA expression profiles and secreted factors observed in ICI-related nephritis suggest that DCs and tertiary lymphoid structures may play a role in other irAEs as well.\\nDespite the insights offered by this study, many gaps in knowledge remain regarding the underlying biology of irMyocarditis. Additional mechanistic, translational, and clinical research will be needed to identify optimal strategies to diagnose, risk-stratify, and manage patients with irMyocarditis. Validation of the candidate biomarkers for irMyocarditis severity suggested herein may be useful towards this goal. The ideal treatment for irMyocarditis would minimize the cardiac damage while also allowing antitumor benefits of ICIs to persist. Future studies of agents used to treat irMyocarditis should therefore assess if they also blunt, permit, or even stimulate antitumor responses. This framework could also be applied broadly to irAEs impacting other organ systems. Identifying patients at risk and disentangling irAEs from effective antitumor immune responses will ultimately help to maximize the benefit of ICIs while minimizing the harm from irAEs.\\nMethods\\nStudy design, patient identification, and sample selection â\\x80\\x93 heart specimens for scRNA-seq\\nHeart tissue was collected at our institution through endomyocardial biopsy or autopsy of patients receiving ICI agents for the treatment of cancer. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their appropriate representatives. All research protocols were approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Boards (#11â\\x80\\x93181 and 13â\\x80\\x93416). Endomyocardial biopsies were collected in the catheterization laboratory as part of the clinical evaluation for suspected irMyocarditis, and a single tissue fragment (~1â\\x80\\x932 mm3) primarily derived from the right side of the interventricular septum was collected for research. One patient (SIC_264) had a biopsy of the left ventricle for clinical reasons. Autopsy samples were obtained by an autopsy pathologist from the right ventricular free wall. Autopsy samples were obtained rapidly (within 6 hours) following the death of patients on ICI agents with or without clinically suspected irMyocarditis. Patients were classified as irMyocarditis cases based on pathological review of tissues by specialized cardiac pathologists as part of routine clinical care. Control heart samples were obtained through two sources: (i) Two samples (SIC_182 and SIC_333) were obtained at our institution from cancer patients who received ICIs and underwent endomyocardial biopsies and/or autopsy with a clinical suspicion for irMyocarditis, but they ultimately did not have histopathological features of irMyocarditis. (ii) Six additional controls were obtained from hearts that were offered but not selected for transplantation and were used to generate a scRNA-seq heart atlas, as described; none of these patients were known to be on ICI therapy. To account for differences in cell proportions or gene expression that occurs in different regions of the heart, we used samples from this control cohort that were obtained from the right ventricle septum or right ventricular free wall to match the anatomic location of samples collected at our institution. The heart atlas also included samples that were enriched for CD45+ cells, which we included in our clustering and select downstream analyses, as outlined in Figure 1b.\\nStudy design, patient identification, and sample selection â\\x80\\x93 heart and tumor specimens for bulk TCR-Î² sequencing\\nSamples for bulk T-cell receptor Î² chain (TCR-Î²) sequencing were identified from the autopsies of cases enrolled in our scRNA-seq cohort as well as additional patients who consented to our tissue banking protocols and were found to have histological evidence of irMyocarditis at time of autopsy. Control heart tissues for bulk TCR-Î² sequencing were identified from patients who were receiving an ICI, did not have evidence of irMyocarditis at autopsy, and for whom archival tissue was available through our biobanking protocol. Tissues were annotated by a cardiac pathologist as â\\x80\\x9cactive,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cborderline,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9chealingâ\\x80\\x9d irMyocarditis, in accordance with the Dallas Criteria.\\nStudy design, patient identification, and sample selection â\\x80\\x93 blood and serum specimens\\nPaired blood and serum were sought prior to the initiation of corticosteroids for the treatment of irMyocarditis in our tissue scRNA-seq cohort as well as additional patients who were diagnosed with irMyocarditis but did not have tissue data. Where available, blood samples were collected or accessed from collaborating biobanking efforts at the following clinically relevant timepoints: prior to the start of ICI (â\\x80\\x9cpre ICIâ\\x80\\x9d timepoints); after the start of ICI but without clinical irMyocarditis (â\\x80\\x9con ICIâ\\x80\\x9d); at the time of clinical irMyocarditis diagnosis but prior to steroid initiation (â\\x80\\x9cpre-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d); after steroid initiation or subsequent therapies (collectively, â\\x80\\x9cpost-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d samples). Control serum samples were identified from biobanked specimens from patients receiving an ICI who did not have evidence of irMyocarditis or any other active irAE.\\nClinical covariates\\nClinical data were obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records, including patient demographics, cancer type, prior cancer therapies received, specific ICI agents used, method of irMyocarditis diagnosis, myocardial biopsy pathology grade, troponin T measurements, and concomitant irAEs.\\nPreparation of tissue samples for scRNA-seq\\nTissue samples obtained by biopsy or autopsy were immediately placed in ice-cold HypoThermosol solution (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA) and kept on ice during transfer to the research facility. Tissue was then washed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline prior to being dissociated with the human tumor dissociation kit according to the manufacturerâ\\x80\\x99s instructions (Miltenyi Biotic, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), with modification such that calcium chloride was added to the enzymatic cocktail to a final concentration of 1.25 mM. Biopsies were cut into â\\x89¤ 1 mm pieces with standard laboratory tissue dissection scissors. Tubes containing tissue fragments in the enzymatic cocktail were placed in a heated shaker at 37Â° C with shaking at 750 RPM for 25 minutes with the machine placed on its side to prevent tissue fragments from settling. Following incubation, the reaction was quenched through the addition of 100 Î¼l human serum. The mixture was further dissociated through manual trituration followed by filtration through 70 Î¼m mesh. Following centrifugation at 350 Ã\\x97 g for 12 minutes, the supernatant was removed, and RBC lysis was performed for two minutes (ACK lysing buffer, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Following a wash step, cells were resuspended in phenol-free RPMI with 2% (v/v) human AB serum.\\nDue to excessive debris, the following myocardial samples obtained from autopsy were sorted by FACS for live, non-red blood cells following tissue dissociation; SIC 176, SIC 182_B, SIC 232, and SIC 264_B (B samples refer to the second of two samples when collected from the same patient). Tissue was prepared for cell sorting by first undergoing dissociation as described above. Following the resuspension of cells in sort buffer (phenol-free RPMI with 2% [v/v] human AB serum), Fc receptors were blocked (Human TruStain FcX, Biolegend 422302), after which cells were incubated with CD235a-PE-Cy5 (Biolegend 306606) for 30 minutes. Following a wash, cells were resuspended in sort buffer containing DAPI. Flow cytometric sorting was performed on a Sony MA900 Cell Sorter (Cell Sorter Software v 3.3.0) to collect live, singlet, CD235aâ\\x88\\x92 cells (Supplementary Figure 9). Sorted cells were centrifuged and resuspended in sort buffer prior to loading in the 10x Chromium chip.\\nPBMC CD45+ enrichment, cell hashing, and CITE-seq staining\\nCryopreserved PMBC samples (total 57 samples across multiple timepoints from 27 patients; Supplementary Tables 4â\\x80\\x936) were thawed at 37Â°C, diluted with a 10x volume of RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma), and centrifuged at 300 Ã\\x97 g for 7 minutes. Cells were resuspended in CITE-seq buffer (RPMI with 2.5% [v/v] human AB serum and 2mM EDTA) and added to 96-well plates. Dead cells were removed with an Annexin-V-conjugated bead kit (Stemcell 17899) and red blood cells were removed with a glycophorin A-based antibody kit (Stemcell 01738); modifications were made to manufacturerâ\\x80\\x99s protocols for each to accommodate a sample volume of 150 uL. Cells were quantified with an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad TC20), after which 2.5 Ã\\x97 105 cells were resuspended in CITE-seq buffer containing TruStain FcX blocker (Biolegend 422302) and MojoSort CD45 Nanobeads (Biolegend 480030). Hashtag antibodies (Biolegend) were added to samples (Supplementary Table 11) followed by a 30 minute incubation on ice. Cells were then washed three times with CITE-seq buffer using a magnet to retain CD45+ cells. Live cells were counted with trypan blue, and 7â\\x80\\x938 samples (each sample with 60,000 cells) bearing different hashtag antibodies were pooled together at equal concentrations. Pooled samples were filtered with 40 Î¼M strainers, centrifuged, and resuspended in CITE-seq buffer with TotalSeq-C antibody cocktail (Biolegend; Supplementary Table 11). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes, followed by three washes with CITE-seq buffer and a final wash in the same buffer without EDTA (RPMI with 2.5% [v/v] human AB serum). Cells were resuspended in this buffer without EDTA, filtered a second time, and counted.\\nscRNA-seq data generation\\nFor heart samples, single cell suspensions containing up to 12,000 cells (or all available cells when total was <12,000) were loaded per channel in 10x Chromium chips. For some samples, two wells in the 10x Chromium chip were loaded to maximize cell recovery; downstream data from these multiple wells were later combined and considered as a single sample. For hashed PBMC samples, samples were diluted to a concentration of 1,200 cells/Î¼l, and 50,000 cells were loaded per well into the 10x Chromium chip channel. According to the manufacturerâ\\x80\\x99s instructions, cell/bead emulsions were generated and transferred to PCR tube strips, after which cDNA libraries were generated. Libraries from heart samples were generated using Chromium Single Cell 5â\\x80\\x99 V1 kits (10x Genomics PN-1000006) except for one sample (SIC_317), which was generated with a 5â\\x80\\x99 V2 kit (10x Genomics PN-1000263) (Supplementary Table 2). Hashed PBMC single cell libraries were generated with the Chromium Single Cell 5â\\x80\\x99 kit (V1.1, 10x Genomics PN-1000020) together with the 5â\\x80\\x99 Feature Barcode library kit (10x Genomics PN-1000080) (Supplementary Table 5). TCR-enriched cDNA libraries were generated with the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment kit (10x Genomics PN-1000005). Library quality was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.\\nAll heart sample gene expression libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500/550 instrument using the high output v2.5 75 cycles kit with the following sequencing parameters: read 1 = 26; read 2 = 56; index 1 = 8; index 2 =0. TCR-enriched libraries from heart tissue were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq 500/550 instrument using the high output v2.5 150 cycle kit with the following sequencing parameters: read 1= 30, read 2 = 130, index 1 = 8, index 2 = 0. All hashed PBMC CITE-seq, feature barcode (i.e., ADT and HTO libraries), and TCR libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq instrument using the S4 300 cycles flow with the following sequencing parameters: read 1 = 26 ; read 2 = 91 ; index 1 = 8; index 2 =0.\\nscRNA-seq read alignment and quantification\\nRaw sequencing data was pre-processed with CellRanger (v3.0.2, 10x Genomics) to demultiplex FASTQ reads, align reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38, v3.0.0 from 10x Genomics), and count unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to produce a cell Ã\\x97 gene count matrix. All count matrices were then aggregated with Pegasus (v1.1.0, Python) using the aggregate_matrices function. Low-quality droplets were filtered out of the matrix prior to proceeding with downstream analyses using the percent of mitochondrial UMIs and number of unique genes detected as filters (heart tissue = < 20% mitochondrial UMIs, > 300 unique genes; PBMCs = < 20% mitochondrial UMIs, > 400 unique genes). The percent of mitochondrial UMI was computed using 13 mitochondrial genes (MT-ND6, MT-CO2, MT-CYB, MT-ND2, MT-ND5, MT-CO1, MT-ND3, MT-ND4, MT-ND1, MT-ATP6, MT-CO3, MT-ND4L, MT-ATP8) using the qc_metrics function in Pegasus. The counts for each remaining cell in the matrix were then log-normalized by computing the log1p(counts per 100,000), which we refer to in the text and figures as logCPM. The detailed quality control statistics for these datasets are compiled in Supplementary Tables 2 and 6.\\nBasic clustering\\nAll cells from all samples were utilized for clustering. First, 2,000 highly variable genes were selected using the highly_variable_features function in Pegasus and used as input for principal component analysis. To account for technical variability between donors, the resulting principal component scores were aligned using the Harmony algorithm. The resulting principal components were used as input for Leiden clustering and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm (spread=1, min-dist=0.5). The number of principal components used for each blood clustering (CD4 T = 16; CD8 T/NK = 18 ; MNP = 24) and tissue clustering (T/NK = 24; MNP = 35; non-immune = 50) was decided via molecular cross-validation.\\nMarker gene identification and cell annotation\\nThe marker genes defining each distinct cell subset from our global and lineage-specific subclustering analyses were determined by applying two complementary methods. First, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the logCPM values of each gene as a predictor of cluster membership using the de_analysis function in Pegasus. Genes with an AUROC â\\x89¥ 0.75 were considered marker genes for a particular cell subset. Second, we created a pseudobulk count matrix by summing the UMI counts across cells for each unique cluster/sample combination, creating a matrix of n genes Ã\\x97 (n samples*n clusters). We performed â\\x80\\x9cone-versus-allâ\\x80\\x9d (OVA) differential expression (DE) analyses for each cell subset using the Limma package (v3.54.0, R). For each subset, we used an input model gene ~ in_clust, where in_clust is a factor with two levels indicating if the sample was in or not in the subset being tested. A moderated T-test was used to calculate P values and compute a false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. We identified marker genes that were significantly associated with a particular subset as having an FDR < 0.05 and a log2 fold change > 0. The AUROC and OVA pseudobulk marker genes for all cell subsets can be found in Supplementary Tables 8 and 12. Marker genes for each cell subset were interrogated and investigated in the context of other published immune profiles to guide our cell subset annotations.\\nAbundance analysis\\nTo identify the association between cell subset abundance and patient group (irMyocarditis, control), we used a mixed-effects association logistic regression model similar to that described by Fonseka et al.. We used the glmer function from the lme4 package (v1.1â\\x80\\x9331, R) to fit a logistic regression model for each cell subset. Each subset was modeled independently with a â\\x80\\x9cfullâ\\x80\\x9d model as follows:  where  is a binary indicator set to 1 when a cell belongs to the given cell subset or 0 otherwise,  is a factor with 2 levels (irMyocarditis or control), and  is a factor indicating the donor. The notation  indicates that  is a random intercept. To determine significant associations, a â\\x80\\x9cnullâ\\x80\\x9d model of  was fit and a likelihood ratio test was used to compare the full and null models. A false discovery rate was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach and clusters with an FDR < 10% were considered significant.\\nSince we were underpowered to investigate differences between fatal and non-fatal irMyocarditis in our heart scRNA-seq data, we sought to identify associations between cell subset frequencies and clinically measured serum troponin levels, a previously described correlate of irMyocarditis severity. We performed linear regression on each cell subset individually, using the model log(troponin) ~ log(abundance) where troponin is an individualâ\\x80\\x99s serum troponin T level measured closest to time of tissue sample collection (no greater than Â±2 days) and abundance represented the relative proportion a cell subset represented in a given sample.\\nTo accurately measure the abundance of each cellular component of heart tissue, we used only unenriched samples (â\\x80\\x9cnativeâ\\x80\\x9d fractions) and excluded the CD45+-enriched samples from the published heart atlas. In the case of SIC_182, a control patient who underwent a biopsy (sample â\\x80\\x9cSIC_182_Aâ\\x80\\x9d) and then an autopsy (â\\x80\\x9cSIC_182_Bâ\\x80\\x9d) but did not have irMyocarditis and never received immunosuppression, data from this patientâ\\x80\\x99s two samples were combined and treated as a single timepoint.\\nDifferential gene expression analysis\\nComparisons between irMyocarditis and control heart tissue was limited to just samples prior to corticosteroids administration (â\\x80\\x9cpre-corticosteroidâ\\x80\\x9d) and included both native and CD45+ enriched samples from the heart cell atlas to account for the paucity of immune cells in uninflamed hearts (Figure 1B). Analyses were performed on pseudobulk count matrices using the DESeq2 package (v. 1.38.2, R). The input model was gene ~ case, where case was a binary variable indicating if the sample came from an irMyocarditis patient or control.\\nSignificant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using a Wald test (FDR < 0.1) (Supplementary Table 14). Select DEGs were visualized with the ComplexHeatmap package (v.2.14.0, R).\\nCell-cell communication analysis\\nTo infer potential receptor:ligand interactions between cell-cell pairs, we used CellPhoneDB (v2.1.7, Python) and ran the algorithm independently on irMyocarditis heart and control cells. Each cell subset was tested as both a sender (ligand) and receiver (receptor) population as defined by the algorithm, and all possible combinations of cell-cell pairs were tested. We restricted potential interactions to those where the receptor and ligand were each expressed in >10% of their respective cell subset and in at least 20 cells, with significance defined as an empirical P < 0.001. These potential interactions were further filtered to include only those where at least the receptor and/or ligand were differentially expressed between irMyocarditis and control (see above Differential Gene Expression section), and the receptor:ligand interaction was validated by an exhaustive literature search.\\nSecreted factors analysis\\nPeripheral blood was collected from irMyocarditis and control patients in serum separator tubes. Following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 890g, serum was collected and stored at â\\x88\\x9280Â° C. Aliquots of undiluted serum were analyzed for the presence of 71 secreted factors through multiplex immunoassay (Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 71-Plex Panel [catalog #HD71], Eve Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada). Log +1 transformed values were compared using a two-sided T-test.\\nTissue/bulk TCR data generation\\nFour autopsy cases were identified with available matched irMyocarditis, tumor, and histologically normal tissue adjacent to tumor. This normal adjacent tissue was used as â\\x80\\x9ccontrolâ\\x80\\x9d tissue. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides were stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and annotated by a board-certified cardiac pathologist to indicate regions of irMyocarditis, tumor, and normal parenchyma. Marked regions of interest were manually macroscopically dissected using a scalpel to scrape tissue from serial unstained slides into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes pre-filled with 1 ml of xylene. Genomic DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit instructions (Qiagen). T-cell receptor Î² chain (TCR-Î²) sequencing of the CDR3 region was performed (immunoSEQ Â® human T-cell receptor beta [hsTCRB], Adaptive Biotechnologies). We also profiled heart tissue for four cancer patients receiving an ICI who consented to our collection protocol, underwent an autopsy, and did not have evidence of irMyocarditis (â\\x80\\x9cheart controlsâ\\x80\\x9d) (Supplementary Table 3).\\nComparison of irMyocarditis and tumor TCR-Î² repertoires\\nFor comparisons between heart and tumor TCR repertoires, the frequencies, and not the absolute counts, of TCR clones were compared to account for differential recovery of TCR-Î² sequences from various tissues. Expanded TCR-Î² sequences were defined as those accounting for >0.5% of all TCR-Î² sequences recovered from the tissue of interest (heart or tumor). These expanded sequences were then filtered to exclude bystander TCR-Î² sequences by performing a Fisherâ\\x80\\x99s exact test on each, comparing the proportion of the TCR-Î² sequence in adjacent normal tissue to that of the tissue of interest (heart or tumor). Sequences with an FDR < 5% were considered enriched in their given tissue site (heart or tumor).\\nTCR-Î² sequence diversity\\nDiversity curves that measured Hillâ\\x80\\x99s diversity metric across diversity orders 0â\\x80\\x934 were created using the package alakazam (v1.0.2, R) with the alphaDiversity function. Hillâ\\x80\\x99s diversity metric was only calculated on samples with â\\x89¥100 total TCR-Î² sequences.\\nExamination of shared TCR-Î² clones in heart and blood\\nFor bulk TCR-Î²-seq data, expanded TCR-Î² sequences were defined as those that represented > 0.5% of the bulk repertoire and were found to have a read count â\\x89¥ 2. For sc-TCR-Î²-seq data, expanded TCR-Î² sequences were those that represented > 0.5% of the sc-TCR-Î²seq repertoire and were found in â\\x89¥ 2 cells. For patients with both bulk TCR-Î²-seq and sc-TCR-Î²-seq data, these data were analyzed together. Expanded heart TCR-Î² clones were then compared to TCR-Î² clones recovered from PBMC scRNA-seq data. PBMC cell subsets were investigated for their association with the presence of expanded TCR-Î² heart clones by fitting a logistic regression model using the glmer function from the lme4 package (v1.1â\\x80\\x9331, R). For each donor, each subset was modeled independently with the full model cluster ~ 1 + myo_clone, where myo_clone is a binary variable where the value was 1 if the cell had an expanded irMyocarditis TCR-Î² and 0 if it did not. An alternative null model cluster ~ 1 was then fit and a likelihood ratio test was used to compare the full and null models. Cell subsets with an FDR < 5% were considered to be enriched for expanded irMyocarditis TCR-Î² sequences.\\nCD1c Staining\\nFFPE tissue sections from six irMyocarditis cases and four control hearts were stained using a Leica Bond RX automated stainer. Anti-CD1c-OTI2F4 mAb (Abcam ab156708) were labeled with DAB chromogen (Leica Bond Polymer Refine Detection DS9800) using EDTA based pH 9 epitope retrieval condition and 20 ug/ml antibody concentration.\\nImage processing/data analysis\\nWhole slide images of stained slides were acquired at 40x (0.13um/pixel) resolution using an MoticEasyScan Infinity digital pathology scanner. Cell segmentation and phenotyping was performed within annotated tissue regions using HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs, v3.32541.184). Areas that contained debris or tissue folds were excluded from the analysis. The Multiplex IHC v3.1.4 module was used for identification of putative CD1c+ cells, which was based on signal intensity within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The candidate cells suggested by this automated analysis were then manually validated for each sample for cell phenotyping quality. Summary tables containing cell phenotype information were exported for analysis across samples (Supplementary Table 19).\\nData and Material availability\\nscRNA-seq count matrices and related data will be available in the GEO database upon publication, and raw human sequencing data will be available in the controlled access repository dbGaP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/) upon publication.',\n",

       " 'Cardiotoxicity Secondary to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in the Elderly: Safety in Real-World Data\\nSimple Summary\\nImmunotherapy is the mainstay treatment for most solid tumours. However, its cardiotoxicity is not yet known and studied, and its uncertainty is even greater in elderly patients. For this reason, this ambispective study was conducted in 195 patients over 70 years of age who were treated with immunotherapy. The percentage of patients with cardiotoxicity was 1.54%; 1.35% of patients with previous heart disease were diagnosed with cardiotoxicity, and 1.65% of those without previous heart disease were diagnosed with cardiotoxicity. The median time from the initiation of treatment until the cardiac event was 45 days. The most frequent toxicity was myocarditis, which was identified in 66.7% of patients, followed by arrhythmias in 33.3% of patients. In conclusion, immunotherapy is shown to be a safe treatment in elderly cancer patients in terms of cardiotoxicity.\\nAbstract\\nIntroduction: Immunotherapy represents a key pillar of cancer treatments, with high response rates and long survival. Its use is increasing, mainly at the expense of the geriatric population due to the ageing of this population. However, despite its benefit, its safety in certain areas such as cardiotoxicity is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the safety of immunotherapy in elderly patients using real-world data. Methods: This is an ambispective study of patients â\\x89¥ 70 years old with solid tumours who were treated with immunotherapy at the University Hospital of Salamanca. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using the CTCAEv5.0 criteria. Results: In total, 195 patients were included (76.9% male and 23.1% female), with a mean age of 75 years [70â\\x80\\x9393]. The percentage of patients with cardiotoxicity was 1.54%; 1.35% of patients with previous heart disease were diagnosed with cardiotoxicity, and 1.65% of those without previous heart disease were diagnosed with cardiotoxicity. The median time from the initiation of treatment until the cardiac event was 45 days [14â\\x80\\x9396]. The most frequent toxicity was myocarditis in 66.7% of patients, followed by arrhythmias in 33.3% of patients. Conclusions: Immunotherapy is shown to be a safe treatment in elderly cancer patients in terms of cardiotoxicity. The event rate shows no difference between patients with or without cardiac comorbidity.\\n1. Introduction\\nImmunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been a revolution in the treatment of cancer patients which has experienced exponential growth over the last 10 years. Since the approval of Ipilimumab (an antibody against the CTLA-4 receptor) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, several drugs have been introduced into solid tumour treatment regimens (Supplementary Material, Table S1). The rates of patients alive at 5 years with metastatic tumours who are treated with immunotherapy for lung cancer or melanoma are as high as 20â\\x80\\x9330%. Furthermore, these drugs are increasingly used in patients over 70â\\x80\\x9375 years of age due to the ageing of the Western population.\\nHowever, their increased use in routine clinical practice, in many cases in patients belonging to the geriatric population, also leads to an increase in adverse side effects. These immuno-related effects (irAEs) can affect virtually any organ, and in rare cases, the consequences can be severe (1â\\x80\\x932% mortality). The iatrogenicity described is very diverse, but one of the most serious and currently underestimated complications is cardiovascular toxicity.\\nImmune-related cardiovascular adverse events comprise a wide range of entities, the most frequent being arrhythmias, myocarditis with or without ventricular dysfunction (symptomatic or asymptomatic), and pericardial abnormalities (Figure 1). Cardiotoxicity associated with ICIs is estimated to have an incidence of 1â\\x80\\x933%, although more recent studies have shown rates as high as 10â\\x80\\x9312%, although it varies between series, as well as according to the treatments prescribed (the rate is higher in combination treatments of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA4). The morbidity and mortality that this toxicity can cause in cancer patients, especially in the geriatric population, makes it essential to know the safety of immunotherapy in this spectrum of patients. Furthermore, cardiotoxicity presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that are currently under study which are even more complex to analyse in the geriatric population. The aim of this study is to assess the safety of immunotherapy treatments on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in elderly cancer patients using real-life data in solid tumours.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Sources of Data\\nAn ambispective study was performed with a population registered through the data system of the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (Salamanca, Spain). The patients selected for this study were those with a diagnosis of a solid tumour who had received immunotherapy treatment (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, or anti-CTLA4) with an age at the start of treatment greater than or equal to 70 years. Data on drug use, as well as clinical and analytical data, were obtained from the medical records and databases of the Medical Oncology Service.\\nEpidemiological: age (years) and sex.\\nOncological: tumour (location, stage, histology, and oncological treatment), PDL-1, and driver mutations.\\nType of treatment: type of immunotherapy, number of doses, and line treatment.\\nResponse: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR).\\nCardiac: cardiac comorbidity, the treatment of cardiac pathology, and cardiotoxicity (number and types of events).\\nClinical and analytical data and comorbidities: general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG), analytical data (blood count, creatinine, liver function, proteins, and glycemia), body mass index (BMI), general toxicity (grade), and associated cardiovascular factors and comorbidities.\\nThe fundamental data collected for this study were:\\nThe patients selected for the study were treated at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca in all cases, and their treatments were followed until the time of data analysis.\\n2.2. Cohort Construction\\nThe cohort of patients for the study was established via hospital discharge records collected between 1 January 2014 and 31 August 2022 (Supplementary Material, Figure S1). The prospective cohort was recruited from January 2021. The cohort was restricted to those individuals who were diagnosed with a metastatic solid tumour and treated with immunotherapy at an age equal or greater than 70 years. To facilitate the analysis, two baseline cohorts were also created according to the types of tumours the patients had (subgroup 1 comprised patients with non-small-cell lung cancer â\\x80\\x9cNSCLCâ\\x80\\x9d, and subgroup 2 comprised patients with all other solid tumours). Because there is no consensus in oncology to define at what age a patient belongs to the geriatric population, 70 years was chosen as the cut-off age in most studies in this field (American Society of Clinical Oncology â\\x80\\x9cASCOâ\\x80\\x9d definition).\\n2.2.1. Inclusion Criteria\\nPatients who had received ICIs in any line of treatment, both in monotherapy and in different combinations such as with chemotherapy, other ICIs, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\\nPatients with a diagnosis of a solid tumour in any stage.\\nPatients who had all the clinical information necessary for the analysis of the objectives collected.\\n2.2.2. Exclusion Criteria\\nPatients using immunotherapy for haematological tumours.\\nThe clinical information necessary for the study had not been collected.\\n2.3. Objectives and Definitions\\nThe primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of immunotherapy treatments in elderly cancer patients on the occurrence of cardiac events in the context of cardiotoxicity (defined as a cardiac event or alteration secondary directly or indirectly to immunotherapy treatment). Immune-related cardiac toxicity was established and defined in patients using the definitions of the main clinical guidelines. The secondary objectives were to analyse whether the safety of immunotherapy is similar in patients who have cardiac comorbidities versus those who do not and to study the epidemiology of the cohort to understand the phenotype of geriatric oncology patients with cardiac comorbidity in whom immunotherapy is to be used.\\nCardiac comorbidity was grouped into five subgroups (arrhythmic, cardiomyopathies and pericardial abnormalities, ischaemic, valvular heart disease, and heart failure). Cardiac events were subdivided into those related to immunotherapy versus those categorised as not related to immunotherapy. PFS was defined as the time in months from the initiation of immunotherapy treatment to radiological or clinical progression, patient death, or loss to follow-up during treatment. OS was the time in months from the initiation of immunotherapy treatment to patient death or loss to follow-up. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients whose best radiological response was a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and DCR was the percentage of the sum of CR, PR, and disease stabilisation (DS).\\nRadiological response was established in four groups (CR, PR, SD, progression, or PD), according to the definition of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Toxicity was collected and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). For cardiotoxicity, CTCAE v5.0â\\x80\\x9427 November 2017, pages 5â\\x80\\x9310, was used in June 2023 (available at:  (accessed on 1 December 2017)).\\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\\nEstimates of the differences between populations at the epidemiological level were estimated using comparative statistical tests of medians and percentages. Survival rates were calculated in months and expressed as medians with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Median survival rates were calculated using the Kaplanâ\\x80\\x93Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to test the association of predictive factors with PFS and OS.\\nTo avoid confounding factors, sub-analyses were established. Additional proportional hazards models were constructed including the potential confounders. In the results section, lung cancer patients were analysed in a separate subgroup as a majority subpopulation. A logistic regression model was constructed to explain those factors explaining response or poor response to ICIs. The statistical significance of the study was established a priori at p < 0.05. The software used was SPSS, version 25 (IBMÂ®).\\n3. Results\\n3.1. General Characteristics of the Sample\\nA total of 195 elderly patients treated with immunotherapy for metastatic solid tumours were included for the study (general characteristics of the sample are given in Table 1). In total, 76.9% of the patients were males and 23.1% were females. The mean age of the study was 75 years [70â\\x80\\x9393]. The most frequent tumour was represented by NSCLC, with 99 patients out of 195 (50.8%), followed by urothelial carcinomas with 29 patients (14.9%), melanoma with 23 patients (11.8%), renal tumours with 22 patients (11.3%), and small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) with 7 patients (3.6%). The most commonly used drug of all was Nivolumab in 94 patients (48.2%), followed by Pembrolizumab in 64 patients (32.8%), and Atezolizumab in 27 patients (13.8%). The mean number of doses received per patient was 7.5 doses [1â\\x80\\x9398].\\nWhen analysing the overall immunotoxicity of the sample, 56 (28.7%) of the total number of patients had some type of immuno-related toxicity. The most frequently observed toxicity was thyroiditis in 14 patients (7.2%), followed by gastrointestinal toxicity in 9 patients (4.6%) and hepatic toxicity in 9 patients (4.6%). Toxicity was grade 3â\\x80\\x934 in 15 patients (7.7%). Within grade 4 toxicity (5 patients, 2.1%), haematological toxicity was observed in two patients (neutropenia in one patient and autoimmune thrombopenia in another patient). The remaining grade 4 toxicities were pneumonitis, nephritis, and colitis (see Table 2).\\nThere was a statistically significant association between OS and those patients with some form of immunotoxicity. OS was observed for 17 months in those patients with immunotoxicity versus 12 months in those without (p = 0.012; HR 0.59 [95 CI 0.39â\\x80\\x930.91]) (Figure 2). This association was not observed for PFS, which was 10 months for patients with immunotoxicity versus 7 months for patients without immunotoxicity (p = 0.151). A statistically significant association was also observed between response and toxicity (p = 0.004). Of the total of nine complete responses in the sample, a total of seven had some form of immunotoxicity.\\n3.2. Cardiac Comorbidity of the Sample\\nWithin the majority subgroup of patients with NSCLC, a total of 35 patients out of 99 (35.4%) had some type of cardiac comorbidity, with some patients having more than one cardiac comorbidity. Within the classification groups, the comorbidities presented were as follows: (1) arrhythmias, 14 patients (14.1%); (2) ischaemic pathology, 15 patients (15.2%); (3) heart failure, 6 patients (6.1%); (4) valvular heart disease, 5 patients (5.1%); and (5) cardiomyopathies and pericardial abnormalities, 2 patients (2.0%).\\nIn the rest of the tumour group, 39 patients out of 96 (40.6%) had some type of cardiac comorbidity prior to the initiation of immunotherapy treatment. The following comorbidities were found: (1) arrhythmias, 6 patients (6.3%); (2) ischaemic pathology, 15 patients (15.6%); (3) heart failure, 4 patients (4.2%); (4) valvular heart disease, 2 patients (2.1%); and (5) cardiomyopathies and pericardial abnormalities, 2 patients (2.1%).\\nIn addition to cardiac comorbidity, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors in the sample and the patientsâ\\x80\\x99 ECOG data at the start of immunotherapy treatment were analysed. A total of 49 patients had no cardiovascular risk factors at the initiation of ICI (25.1%), with 46 patients having diabetes mellitus (23.6%), 102 patients having hypertension (52.3%), and 100 patients having dyslipidaemia (51.3%). The ECOG scores of the included patients were, in most cases, 0â\\x80\\x931 (164 patients, 84.1%), and â\\x89¥2 in 31 patients (15.9%).\\n3.3. Cardiac Events Post-Immunotherapy (Primary Endpoint)\\nAmong the patients with NSCLC, 15 patients had a post-immunotherapy cardiac event (15.2%), with a total of 6 patients having arrhythmic events, 1 patient having an alteration derived from valvular heart disease, 6 patients having heart failure or the decompensation of already diagnosed heart failure, and 4 patients having cardiomyopathy or alterations of the pericardium. Of the 64 patients without previous cardiac comorbidity, a total of 5 patients had a de novo cardiac event (7.8%). Among the 35 patients with previous cardiac pathologies, a total of 10 patients had cardiac episodes (28.6%). Of all the events observed in the 99 patients, only one (1.01%) was associated with immunotoxicity (atrial tachycardia in the context of second-line nivolumab monotherapy) in a patient with no history of heart disease.\\nOf the remaining patients in the sample, 10 patients had a cardiac event (10.5%). Arrhythmic events were observed in five patients, valvular heart disease in two patients, de novo heart failure or decompensation in two patients, and cardiomyopathy or pericardial abnormalities in three patients. The number of patients with events among the group with previous heart disease was five (12.8%). Among patients without heart disease, the number of patients who had an episode was four (7.02%). There were two immunotherapy-related events (2.1%). One event was grade 5 myocarditis (death of the patient) in a patient without previous heart disease (treatment with nivolumab monotherapy), and the other event was grade 2 myocarditis in a patient with previous heart disease (treatment with pembrolizumab in combination with an ITK).\\nThus, in the total sample of 195 patients, there were a total of three immuno-related cardiac events (1.54%). Among patients with previous heart disease (74 patients) the number of cardiotoxic events was one (1.35%). Among patients without heart disease (121 patients) the number of patients with immuno-related events was two (1.65%). The median number of days from the start of immunotherapy to the cardiac event was 45 days [14â\\x80\\x9396]. A summary is provided in Table 3.\\n4. Discussion\\nNowadays, immunotherapy treatments are increasingly studied and known in clinical practice. Immune-related side effects and treatments for these complications are well detailed in clinical guidelines. However, cardiotoxicity is one of the most common morbidity and mortality issues, with even greater implications in patients belonging to the geriatric population. As indicated in the introductory section, cardiotoxicity is estimated to range from 1 to 3% (from 10 to 12% in several series), although its incidence and severity vary greatly depending on the type of cardiac alteration. In the case of the study sample, the incidence of cardiotoxicity was 1.54%, which indicates that in global terms, cardiotoxicity in the spectrum of geriatric patients is similar to the series published so far.\\n4.1. Submission Times of Cardiotoxicity\\nA second important fact to understand the lack of data on cardiotoxicity as an irAE is the time to the onset of the event. In the different series, the range varies greatly, with the median number of days in the different studies ranging from 17 to 65 days. Among the patients included in our study who experienced toxicity, the median day was 45 days, reflecting along with the incidence the similarity of cardiotoxicity in the geriatric patients in our investigation, along with the data at the general level. In all cases of cardiotoxicity, the treatment was an anti-PD1 without combination with another ICI, although only three patients out of 195 had combination treatment.\\n4.2. Cardiotoxicity in the Patients of the Sample (Secondary Objectives)\\nAmong the types of cardiotoxicities, the most frequent and recognised is myocarditis, which accounts for 60â\\x80\\x9380% (0.1â\\x80\\x930.2% overall as an irAE), followed by arrhythmias in 25â\\x80\\x9335% and pericardial alterations in 10â\\x80\\x9315%. In our data, myocarditis accounted for 67% of all cardiac events and arrhythmias 33.3%. This figure is like the published figure, although there is a bias in both our series and the literature data secondary to the absence of data on the relationship between other cardiac pathologies and immunotherapy. It is therefore possible that there is an under-diagnosis of other events such as pericarditis or heart failure.\\nAnother key finding in our sample was the division of the overall cohort between patients with and without a prior cardiac comorbidity. Immune-related cardiovascular adverse events were similar between the two groups (1.35% vs. 1.65%, respectively). This shows that despite the overall safety in geriatric oncology patients, in whom incidence data are similar to the general population, there is no increased risk of a toxic event in those patients with a cardiac comorbidity. This is of relevance in this population subgroup due to the high incidence of cardiac comorbidities compared to the general population in which younger patients have no previous cardiac disorders.\\n4.3. Limitations of the Study\\nAfter the interpretation of the data, it is important to be aware that the study has a number of limitations due to the fact that it was an ambispective study. In addition, the interpretation of cardiotoxicity in elderly patients is more complex due to the higher prevalence and incidence of cardiac pathology compared to the general oncology population. Furthermore, almost all patients received anti-PD(L)1 treatments without combinations with other immunotherapy drugs, so this may contribute to a bias in the results. The presence of these limitations, together with the absence of studies in this population, points to the need for prospective studies in this field.\\n5. Conclusions\\nTreatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is well tolerated in elderly patients, as supported by the results of our study, which indicate a cardiotoxicity rate comparable to that observed in the general population. Moreover, in line with our results, the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities does not seem to influence the risk of immune-related cardiovascular adverse events. Further prospective studies will be needed in the future to validate these findings.\\nDisclaimer/Publisherâ\\x80\\x99s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

       " \"Multiorgan Failure From Nivolumab and Ipilimumab: A Case Report and Literature Review\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as standard of care have revolutionized the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab improves treatment efficacy and prolongs survival compared to monotherapy alone. However, combination therapy is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. We report an uncommon yet important case of multi-organ failure in a patient following a single dose of nivolumab plus ipilimumab.\\nA 60-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis in remission and metastatic melanoma was admitted on February 25, 2021, for presumed sepsis, after presenting with neutropenic fever. His brain metastases were previously resected on January 14, 2021, and he was started on dexamethasone 4 mg BID for six weeks. On February 11, 2021, he received one dose of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, per the CheckMate-067 protocol. He presented 14 days later with fever, diarrhea, pancytopenia, renal failure, drug-induced hepatitis, and myocarditis. The infectious workup was negative. His neutropenia responded to growth factors. He was diagnosed with interstitial nephritis due to immunotherapy and treated with corticosteroids. His symptoms resolved with concomitant improvement of his renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. He was discharged home in a stable condition.\\nAlthough these specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are uncommon and rarely occur simultaneously, ICIs can trigger non-specific immune system activation, resulting in widespread inflammatory effects. Since irAEs can lead to multi-organ failure, as evidenced in this case, early recognition and institution of high-dose steroids are critical to preventing rapid deterioration. Given that ICI therapy is the standard of care for several cancers and is often studied in clinical trials, increased education on irAE toxicity and updated algorithms on the management of febrile cancer patients are warranted.\\nIntroduction\\nThe discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) revolutionized metastatic melanoma treatment and they have become the standard of care. ICIs include anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associate antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies, such as ipilimumab, and anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. ICIs are considered first-line therapy for metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancerÂ\\xa0and are also utilized for Hodgkin's lymphoma and some types of head and neck, bladder, and renal cancer. The results of CheckMate-067 demonstrated that the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg improves objective response rate (ORR) and prolongs both progression-free survival and overall survival compared to monotherapy with either drug in unresectable late-stage melanoma. However, this combination regimen is associated with increased immune-related adverse events (irAE).\\nGenerally, ICIs are more tolerable with a better safety profile than traditional chemotherapy. Adverse effects of immunotherapy are generally autoimmune-induced inflammation due to their mechanism of action increasing non-specific T cell activity. The most common irAEs include colitis, endocrinopathies, hepatitis, and pneumonitis. Up to 96% of metastatic melanoma patients who receive combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab experienced irAEs, with 59% being Grade 3 or 4 irAE. The results of CheckMate-511 demonstrated that the alternative dosing of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg significantly reduced the rates of Grade 3 or 4 irAE without inferior ORR, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Although the likelihood of immunotherapy affecting more than one organ is uncommon, patients who received combination immunotherapy experienced significantly higher rates of irAEs compared to single-agent ipilimumab, 31%Â\\xa0and 7%, respectively. We present a unique case of multi-organ failure in a patient after receiving a single dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of his metastatic melanoma.\\nCase presentation\\nA 60-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis in remission, hypertension, and metastatic melanoma was transferred for presumed sepsis secondary to neutropenic fever. Two years prior to admission, the patient had noticed a purple skin lesion on his right shin, which was subsequently diagnosed as melanoma on biopsy. In addition, a right inguinal lymph node fine needle aspiration (FNA) was also positive for melanoma. PD-L1 was expressed in 5% of tumor cells. The initial staging was consistent with stage IIIC melanoma and was deemed unresectable. A subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed nodal metastases in the right lung and liver. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain indicated the presence of a mass in the right foramen magnum. MRI spine noted diffuse axial spine lesions. The patient was subsequently started on pembrolizumab and completed 19 cycles until treatment was stopped due to a flare of his underlying ulcerative colitis. His flare was diagnosed clinically on the basis of his worsening diarrhea, but had negative imaging subsequently and was treated with an oral prednisone taper over six months. Post-treatment computed tomography (CT) chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed stable disease.\\nHe was observed off treatment for about one year, during which he was started on levothyroxine supplementation for ICI-induced hypothyroidism. A surveillance MRI brain obtained one year later showed multiple enhancing masses in bilateral cerebral hemispheres with associated local mass effects. Neurosurgery performed a right frontal lobe mass resection, which wasÂ\\xa0followed by gamma knife radiosurgery two weeks laterÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0dexamethasone therapy for six weeks.\\nOne month following resection, the patient received an initial dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Two weeks later, he presented to an outside hospital with generalized weakness, poor appetite, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. Initial vitals were significant for a fever of 102.1Â°F. His complete blood count (CBC) revealed neutropenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.2 x 103/Î¼L and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.005 x 103/Î¼L. He was treated empirically for sepsis, secondary to neutropenic fever, with cefepime and vancomycin and was transferred to our institution for a higher level of care.\\nOn evaluation at our institution, he was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His physical exam was unremarkable. CBC revealed pancytopenia with WBC of 0.2 x 103/Î¼L, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 93 x 103/Î¼L. Further laboratory workup revealed a creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL (baseline 0.9 mg/dL), glomerular filtration rateÂ\\xa0(GFR) of 13 mL/min, alkaline phosphatase of 116 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 17 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 21 IU/L, total bilirubin of 7.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 5.2 mg/dL, international normalized ratioÂ\\xa0(INR) of 2.02, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 159 pg/mL, and lactate of 0.9 mmol/L (Table 1). Urinalysis (UA) showed proteinuria. Troponin was elevated to 907 ng/L, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal sinus rhythm, unchanged from the prior.\\nHis chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular congestion. CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated colitis of the ascending and sigmoid colon. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of biliary obstruction or common bile duct dilation. Renal ultrasound was unremarkable. Echocardiogram demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 46%, globally decreased systolic and diastolic function, and a severely dilated left atrium (Video 1, Table 2). Cardiac MRI showed normal size and morphology of the left ventricle and right ventricle, mild global hypokinesia, and no evidence of abnormal delayed myocardial hyperenhancement to suggest scar or inflammation.\\nHematology/Oncology was consulted and recommended the initiation of filgrastim and broad-spectrum antibiotics for his neutropenic fever. Nephrology was consulted and deemed his grade 4 acute kidney injury to be secondary to acute interstitial nephritis. A renal biopsy was not performed due to severe thrombocytopenia. For his new onset heart failure, the patient was started on losartan, hydralazine, and furosemide. The patient was started on 125mg IV methylprednisolone for treatment of multiple irAEs, including myocarditis, hepatotoxicity, pancytopenia resulting in neutropenic fever, and nephritis.\\nInfectious workup, including blood cultures, urine cultures, and stool cultures, remained negative. The patient improved clinically, and antibiotics were discontinued by day 3 of hospitalization. With growth factors, his ANC normalized by hospital day 7. His creatinine improved throughout his hospital course and normalized by follow-up one-week post-discharge (Table 1). The patient's total bilirubin quickly down-trended from 7.5 mg/dL on day 1, to 2.6 mg/dL on day 3 of hospitalization and continued to decline thereafter. His troponin decreased from 907 ng/L on day 1 to 208 ng/L. Following marked clinical and laboratory improvement with high-dose methylprednisolone, he was discharged on hospital day 8 on a prolonged oral prednisone taper for six weeks (Table 1). The patient fully recovered to his baseline two months after discharge.\\nDiscussion\\nThis case demonstrates a multitude of both common and rare complications of immunotherapy. ICIs can affect virtually all organ systems, though onset and timing vary. Although many of this patientâ\\x80\\x99s irAEs are rare, it is even more uncommon for them to occur simultaneously. The mechanism of irAEs is poorly understood but is thought to involve non-specific T cell over-activation and increased cytokine expression causing a sepsis-like syndrome or aberrant activation of autoreactive T cells. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is considered first-line therapy in the setting of metastatic melanoma as it prolongs progression-free survival and overall survival. However, it is also associated with increased IrAEs, as seen in our patient. Grade 1 or 2 irAEs can be treated by holding the ICI and administering corticosteroids. The use of systemic, high-dose corticosteroids is essential to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications and progression to organ failure. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids do not impact ICI efficacy even when irAEs occur. Grade 3-4 irAEs often necessitate higher doses of corticosteroids and in some instances, absolute cessation of ICIs.\\nThe diagnosis of irAEs is usually one of exclusion. A full medical workup and appropriate subspecialty consultations are warranted to ensure proper diagnosis. Vigilance was very important for this patient given the use of ICIs with his underlying ulcerative colitis and previous ICI-induced hypothyroidism. Our patientâ\\x80\\x99s presentation is astoundingly unique as he exhibited numerous Grade 3-4 irAEs from a single dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab for his metastatic melanoma, resulting in life-threatening multi-organ failure. From a single dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab, he experienced myocarditis, hepatotoxicity, acute renal failure, and pancytopenia resulting in neutropenic fever. Despite the severity of the patient's presenting symptoms, the neurosurgeonâ\\x80\\x99s recommendation of prolonged dexamethasone, prior to initiation of ipilimumab and nivolumab, may have reduced the severity of the patient's presentation.\\nThe patient's acute renal failure was initially attributed to sepsis; however, given his negative infectious workup and hemodynamic stability, sepsis was deemed unlikely. Nephrology deemed this to be a Grade 4 nephritis secondary to iRAE and a renal biopsy was not performed due to severe thrombocytopenia. Rapid improvement in his serum creatinine, following high-dose corticosteroid administration, further supported the presence of ICI-induced renal injury. Secondly, this patient exhibited Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by significant elevation of his conjugated bilirubin. Although hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was considered as a possible etiology of his liver injury and may result from ICIs, his ferritin, fibrinogen, d-dimer, and triglycerides were only mildly elevated and did not meet the criteria for this diagnosis.\\nAlthough dermatologic toxicity is the most common irAE in patients with CTLA-4 or PD-1/LD-L1 blockade, this was not demonstrated in our patient. A systematic review reported ICI-induced diarrhea in 27-54% and colitis in 8-22%. The incidence of hepatotoxicity ranges from 3-9% with ipilimumab and 1-2% with nivolumab. Renal irAEs are rare and seen in about 5% of patients on combination ICI regimens. Hematologic involvement is extremely rare and is seen in less than 1% of patients. Hypothyroidism, as seen in our patient, occurs in 6.6% of patients on monotherapy and 13.2% on combination therapy.\\nMyocarditis is a known, rare complication described in 0.06-1% of patients receiving ICI therapy. In one case series, the majority of patients experiencing cardiotoxicity had prior cardiovascular disease. ECG changes are generally non-specific and highly variable. Biopsy reveals dominant lymphocytic infiltrates with histiocytes (macrophages) in the myocardium with immunohistochemistry staining for CD3 +/CD8+, a few CD4+, and CD68+ cells. Cardiac MRI is the gold standard for non-invasive diagnosis and demonstrates two of the following: (1) increased signal activity on T1- and T2-weighted images reflecting edema; (2) myocardia with more contrast than skeletal muscle reflecting hyperemia; andÂ\\xa0(3) late contrast enhancement with gadolinium reflecting scar. Although our patientâ\\x80\\x99s cardiac MRI did not meet these diagnostic criteria, we believe that his edema and hyperemia likely resolved from the prior two days of high-dose methylprednisolone. Cardiology deemed this patientâ\\x80\\x99s shortness of breath, troponin elevation, and new cardiac findings on echo and cardiac MRI to be most consistent with ICI-induced myocarditis. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are utilized for the treatment of ICI-induced myocarditis. Although multiple second-line agents have been used without evidence, some studies have demonstrated improvement in ejection fraction with corticosteroid treatment.\\nIt is important to note that patients with autoimmune diseases are often excluded from clinical trials involving immunotherapy. Our patientâ\\x80\\x99s history of ulcerative colitis may have placed him at a higher risk compared to patient profiles described in trials and in the literature. His presentation adds to the body of existing literature detailingÂ\\xa0ulcerative colitis flaresÂ\\xa0when treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab. Further research is needed to evaluate both the efficacy and safety of ICI therapy in patients with autoimmune diseases. Additional research to evaluate drug safety profiles in patients with a history of prior irAEs is needed.\\nConclusions\\nThis patient presented withÂ\\xa0multiorgan failure after a single dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab. With the increasing utilization of ICIs in many fields within oncology, this case report demonstrates the importance of monitoring these patients for the development of significant irAEs. This requires ongoing vigilance and a thorough work-up, as irAEs are often a diagnosis of exclusion. Often, a multidisciplinary approach, including input from consultants, is necessary to arrive at the proper diagnosis. Following diagnosis, prompt initiation of corticosteroids is essential to prevent rapid deterioration and reduce the likelihood of severe, fatal outcomes.\\nHuman Ethics\\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study\\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\"]"
